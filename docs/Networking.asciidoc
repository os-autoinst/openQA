# Networking in OpenQA

*This overview is valid only when using QEMU backend!*

Which networking type to use is controlled by the +NICTYPE+
variable. If unset or empty +NICTYPE+ defaults to +user+, ie qemu
user networking which requires no further configuration.

For more advanced setups or tests that require multiple jobs to be
in the same networking the TAP or VDE based modes can be used.

## Qemu user networking

With Qemu [user
networking](http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#User_Networking_.28SLIRP.29)
each jobs gets it's own isolated network with TCP and UDP routed to
the outside. DHCP is provided by qemu. The MAC address of the
machine can be controlled with the +NICMAC+ variable. If not set,
it's +52:54:00:12:34:56+.

## TAP based network

os-autoinst can connect qemu to TAP devices of the host system to
leverage advanced network setups provided by the host by setting +NICTYPE=tap+.

The TAP device to use can be configured with the +TAPDEV+ variable. If not set
defined, ist's automatically set to "tap" + ($worker_instance - 1), i.e.
worker1 uses tap0, worker 2 uses tap1 and so on.

For multiple networks per job (see +NETWORKS+ variable), the following numbering
scheme is used:

[source, bash]
---------------
worker1: tap0 tap64 tap128 ...
worker2: tap1 tap65 tap129 ...
worker3: tap2 tap66 tap130 ...
...
---------------

MAC address of virtual NIC is controlled by +NICMAC+ variable or
automatically computed from $worker_id if not set.

In TAP mode the system administrator is expected to configure the
network, required internet access etc on the host manually.

TAP devices need be owned by the +_openqa-worker+ user for openQA to
be able to access them.

[source, bash]
---------------
tunctl -u _openqa-worker -p -t tap0
---------------
or Wicked way:
[source, xml]
---------------
<!-- /etc/wicked/ifconfig/tap0.xml -->
<interface>
  <name>tap0</name>
  <tap>
    <owner>_openqa-worker</owner>
  </tap>
</interface>
---------------

If you want to use TAP device which doesn't exist on the system,
you need to set CAP_NET_ADMIN capability on qemu binary file:

[source, bash]
---------------
zypper in libcap-progs
setcap CAP_NET_ADMIN=ep /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
---------------

Network setup can be changed after qemu is started using network configure script
specified in TAPSCRIPT variable.

Sample script to add TAP device to existing bridge br0:
[source, bash]
---------------
#!/bin/sh

sudo brctl addif br0 $1
sudo ip link set $1 up
---------------

## TAP with Open vSwitch

The recomended way to configure the network for TAP devices is using Open vSwitch.
There is a support service +os-autoinst-openvswitch.service+ which sets vlan number
of Open vSwitch ports based on +NICVLAN+ variable - this separates the groups of
tests from each other.

+NICVLAN+ variable is dynamically assigned by OpenQA scheduler.

Compared to VDE setup discussed later, Open vSwitch is more complicated to configure,
but provides more robust and scalable network.

Start Open vSwitch and add TAP devices:
[source, bash]
---------------

# start openvswitch.service
systemctl start openvswitch.service
systemctl enable openvswitch.service

#create bridge
ovs-vsctl add-br br0

# add tap devices, use vlan 999 by default, the vlan number is supposed to be changed when the vm starts
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap0 tag=999
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap1 tag=999
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap2 tag=999
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap3 tag=999
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 tap4 tag=999

---------------

If the workers with TAP capability are spread across multiple hosts, the network must be connected.
See Open vSwitch http://openvswitch.org/support/config-cookbooks/port-tunneling/[documentation] for details.

Example configuration of GRE tunnel:
[source, bash]
---------------
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 gre0 -- set interface gre0 type=gre options:remote_ip=<IP address of other host>
---------------

The virtual machines need access to os-autoinst webserver acessible
via IP 10.0.2.2. The IP addresses of VMs are controlled by tests
and are likely to conflict if more independent tests runs in parallel.

The VMs have unique MAC that differs in the last 16 bits (see /usr/lib/os-autoinst/backend/qemu.pm).
os-autoinst-openvswitch.service sets up filtering rules for the following translation scheme which
provide non-conflicting addresses visible from host:

  MAC 52:54:00:12:XX:YY -> IP 10.1.XX.YY

That means that the local port of the bridge must be configured to IP 10.0.2.2
and netmask /15 that covers 10.0.0.0 and 10.1.0.0 ranges.

[source, bash]
---------------
ip addr add 10.0.2.2/15 dev br0
ip route add 10.0.0.0/15 dev br0
ip link set br0 up
---------------

and permanently in /etc/sysconfig/network
[source, bash]
---------------
#/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-br0
BOOTPROTO='static'
IPADDR='10.0.2.2/15'
STARTMODE='auto'
---------------

wicked 0.6.23 and later has enhanced support for the creation and configuration of OpenvSwitch bridges,
so the permanent configuration should look like this:

[source, bash]
---------------
#/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-br0
BOOTPROTO='static'
IPADDR='10.0.2.2/15'
STARTMODE='auto'
OVS_BRIDGE='yes'
OVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_1='tap0'
OVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_2='tap1'
OVS_BRIDGE_PORT_DEVICE_3='tap2'
---------------

The IP 10.0.2.2 can also serve as a gateway to access outside
network. For this, a NAT between br0 and eth0 must be configured
with SuSEfirewall or iptables.

[source, bash]
---------------
# configuration options for NAT with SuSEfirewall
# /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall

FW_ROUTE="yes"
FW_MASQUERADE="yes"
FW_DEV_INT="br0"
---------------


Then it is possible to start the os-autoinst-openvswitch.service
The service uses +br0+ by default. It can be configured for another
bridge name by setting +/etc/sysconfig/os-autoinst-openvswitch+

[source, bash]
---------------
OS_AUTOINST_USE_BRIDGE=bridge_name
---------------

Then, start the service:
[source, bash]
---------------
systemctl start os-autoinst-openvswitch.service
systemctl enable os-autoinst-openvswitch.service
---------------

### Debugging Open vSwitch configuration

Boot sequence with wicked < 0.6.23:

1. wicked - creates tap devices
2. openvswitch - creates the bridge +br0+, adds tap devices to it
3. wicked handles +br0+ as hotplugged device, assignd the IP 10.0.2.2 to it, updates SuSEFirewall
4. os-autoinst-openvswitch - installs openflow rules, handles vlan assignment

Boot sequence with wicked 0.6.23 and newer:

1. openvswitch
2. wicked - creates the bridge +br0+ and tap devices, add tap devices to the bridge,
3. SuSEFirewall
4. os-autoinst-openvswitch - installs openflow rules, handles vlan assignment


The configuration and operation can be checked by the following commands:

ovs-vsctl show

shows the bridge br0, the tap devices are assigned to it


ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0

shows the rules installed by os-autoinst-openvswitch in table=0

* packets from tapX to br0 create additional rules in table=1
* packets from br0 to tapX increase packet counts in table=1
* empty output indicates a problem with os-autoinst-openvswitch service
* zero packet count or missing rules in table=1 indicate problem with tap devices

ipables -L -v

As long as the SUT has access to external network, there should be
nonzero packet count in the forward chain between br0 and external
interface.


## VDE based network

Virtual Distributed Ethernet provides a software switch that runs in
user space. It allows to connect several qemu instances without
affecting the system's network configuration.

The openQA workers need a vde_switch instance running. The workers
reconfigure the switch as needed by the job.

### Basic, single machine tests

To start with a basic configuration like qemu user mode networking,
create a machine with the following settings:

- +VDE_SOCKETDIR=/run/openqa+
- +NICTYPE=vde+
- +NICVLAN=0+

Start switch and user mode networking:

[source, bash]
---------------
systemctl start openqa-vde_switch
systemctl start openqa-slirpvde
---------------

With this setting all jobs on the same host would be in the same
network share the same SLIRP instance though.

### Multi machine tests

Create a machine like above but don't set +NICVLAN+. openQA will
dynamically allocate a VLAN number for all jobs that have
dependencies between each other. By default this VLAN is private and
has no internet access. To enable user mode networking set
+VDE_USE_SLIRP=1+ on one of the machines. The worker running the job
on such a machine will start slirpvde and put it in the correct VLAN
then.
