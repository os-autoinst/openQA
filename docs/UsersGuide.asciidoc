== Introduction

This document provides additional information for use of the web interface or
the REST API as well as administration information.
For administrators it is recommend to have read the
<<Installing.asciidoc#installing,Installation Guide>> first to understand the structure
of components as well as the configuration of an installed instance.

== Use of the web interface

In general the web UI should be intuitive or self-explanatory. Look out for the
little blue help icons and click them for detailed help on specific sections.

Some pages use queries to select what should be shown. The query parameters are
generated on clickable links, for example starting from the index page or the
group overview page clicking on single builds. On the query pages there can be
UI elements to control the parameters, for example to look for more older
builds or only show failed jobs or other settings. Additionally, the query
parameters can be tweaked by hand if you want to provide a link to specific
views.


=== /tests/overview - Customizable test overview page

The overview page is configurable by the filter box. Also, some additional
query parameters can be provided which can be considered advanced or
experimental. For example specifying no build will resolve the latest build
which matches the other parameters specified. Specifying no group will show
all jobs from all matching job groups. Also specifying multiple groups works,
see <<overview_multiple_groups,the following example>>.

[[overview_multiple_groups]]
.The openQA test overview page showing multiple groups at once. The URL query parameters specify the groupid parameter two times to resolve both the "opensuse" and "opensuse test" group.
image::images/tests-overview_multiple_groups.png[test overview page showing multiple groups]

Specifying multiple groups with no build will yield the latest build of the
first group. This can be useful to have a static URL for bookmarking.


=== Description of test suites

Test suites can be described using API commands or the admin table for any operator using the web UI.

[[test_suite_description_edit]]
.Entering a test suite description in the admin table using the web interface:
image::images/test_suite_description_edit.png[test suite description edit field]

If a description is defined, the name of the test suite on the tests overview page shows up as a link. Clicking the link will show the description in a popup. The same syntax as for comments can be used, that is Markdown with custom extensions such as shortened links to ticket systems.

[[test_suite_description_shown]]

image::images/test_suite_description_shown.png[test suite description popup]


=== Review badges ===

Based on comments in the individual job results for each build a certificate
icon is shown on the group overview page as well as the index page to indicate
that every failure has been reviewed, e.g. a bug reference or a test issue
reason is stated:

image::images/review_badges.png[Review badges]

==== Meaning of the different colors ====

* The green icons shows up when there is no work to be done.
* No icon is shown if at least one failure still need to be reviewed.
* The black icon is shown if all review work has been done.

(To simplify, checking for false-negatives is not considered here.)

=== Show bug or label icon on overview if labeled https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/550[gh#550]

* Show bug icon with URL if mentioned in test comments
* Show bug or label icon on overview if labeled

For bugreferences write `<bugtracker_shortname>#<bug_nr>` in a comment, e.g. "bsc#1234", for generic labels use `label:<keyword>` where `<keyword>` can be any valid character up to the next whitespace, e.g. "false_positive". The keywords are not defined within openQA itself. A valid list of keywords should be decided upon within each project or environment of one openQA instance.

[[generic_label]]
.Example for a generic label

[[bug_label]]
.Example for bug label
image::images/bug_label.png[Example of a bug label]

Related issue: https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/10212[#10212]

'Hint:' You can also write (or copy-paste) full links to bugs and issues. The links are automatically changed to the shortlinks (e.g. `https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/11110` turns into https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/11110[poo#11110]). Related issue: https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/11110[[line-through]*poo#11110*]

Also github pull requests and issues can be linked using the generic format
+`<marker>[#<project/repo>]#<id>`+, e.g. https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/issues/1234[gh#os-autoinst/openQA#1234], see https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/973[gh#973]

All issue references are stored within the internal database of openQA. The status can be updated using the `/bugs` API route for example using external tools.

[[labels_closed_tickets]]
.Example for visualization of closed issue references. Upside down icons in red visualize closed issues.
image::images/labels_closed_tickets.png[Example for visualization of closed issue references]


=== Distinguish product and test issues bugref https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/708[gh#708]

``progress.opensuse.org'' is used to track test issues, bugzilla for product
issues, at least for SUSE/openSUSE. openQA bugrefs distinguish this and show
corresponding icons

image::images/tests-overview-issue_icon.png[Different icons for product and test issues]


=== Build tagging ===

==== Tag builds with special comments on group overview ====

Based on comments on the group overview individual builds can be tagged. As
'build' by themselves do not own any data the job group is used to store this
information. A tag has a build to link it to a build. It also has a type
and an optional description. The type can later on be used to distinguish
tag types.

The generic format for tags is
-------------
tag:<build_id>:<type>[:<description>], e.g. tag:1234:important:Beta1.
-------------

The more recent tag always wins.

A 'tag' icon is shown next to tagged builds together with the description on
the group_overview page. The index page does not show tags by default to prevent
a potential performance regression. Tags can be enabled on the index page using the
corresponding option in the filter form at the bottom of the page.

image::images/build_tagging.png[Example of a tag coment and corresponding tagged build]

==== Keeping important builds ====

As builds can now be tagged we come up with the convention that the
'important' type - the only one for now - is used to tag every job that
corresponds to a build as 'important' and keep the logs for these jobs longer so that
we can always refer to the attached data, e.g. for milestone builds, final
releases, jobs for which long-lasting bug reports exist, etc.


=== Filtering test results and builds ===

At the top of the test results overview page is a form which allows filtering tests by result,
architecture and TODO-status.

image::images/filter_form.png[Filter form]

There is also a similar form at the bottom of the index page which allows filtering builds by
group and customizing the limits.


=== Highlighting job dependencies in 'All tests' table

When hovering over the branch icon after the test name children of the job will
be highlighted blue and parents red. So far this only works for jobs displayed on
the same page of the table.

image::images/highlighting_job_dependencies.png[highlighted child jobs]


=== Show previous results in test results page https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/538[gh#538]

On a tests result page there is a tab for ``Next & previous results'' showing
the result of test runs in the same scenario. This shows next and previous
builds as well as test runs in the same build. This way you can easily check
and compare results from before including any comments, labels, bug references
(see next section). This helps to answer questions like ``Is this a new
issue'', ``Is it reproducible'', ``has it been seen in before'', ``how does the
history look like''.

Querying the database for former test runs of the same scenario is a
rather costly operation which we do not want to do for multiple test
results at once but only for each individual test result (1:1 relation).
This is why this is done in each individual test result and not for a
complete build.

Related issue: https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/10212[#10212]

Screenshot of the feature:

image::images/test_details-next_and_previous.png[Next and previous job results]


=== Link to latest in scenario name https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/836[gh#836]

Find the always latest job in a scenario with the link after the
scenario name in the tab ``Next & previous results'' Screenshot:
image::images/test_details-link_to_latest.png[Link to latest in scenario]


=== Add `latest' query route https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/815[gh#815]

Should always refer to most recent job for the specified scenario.

* have the same link for test development, i.e. if one retriggers tests,
the person has to always update the URL. If there would be a static URL
even the browser can be instructed to reload the page automatically
* for linking to the always current execution of the last job within one
scenario, e.g. to respond faster to the standard question in bug reports
``does this bug still happen?''

Examples:

* `tests/latest?distri=opensuse&version=13.1&flavor=DVD&arch=x86_64&test=kde&machine=64bit`
* `tests/latest?flavor=DVD&arch=x86_64&test=kde`
* `tests/latest?test=foobar` - this searches for the most recent job
using test_suite `foobar' covering all distri, version, flavor, arch,
machines. To be more specific, add the other query entries.


=== Allow group overview query by result https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/531[gh#531]

This allows e.g. to show only failed builds. Could be included like in
http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-02/msg00018.html for
``known defects''.

Example: Add query parameters like `…&result=failed&arch=x86_64` to show
only failed for the single architecture selected.


=== Add web UI controls to select more builds in group_overview https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/804[gh#804]

The query parameter `limit_builds' allows to show more than the default
10 builds on demand. Just like we have for configuring previous results,
the current commit adds web UI selections to reload the same page with
higher number of builds on demand. For this, the limit of days is
increased to show more builds but still limited by the selected number.

Example screenshot:

image::images/job_group-limit_builds.png[Select different limit for number of displayed builds]


=== More query parameters for configuring last builds https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/575[gh#575]

By using advanced query parameters in the URLs you can configure the
search for builds. Higher numbers would yield more complex database
queries but can be selected for special investigation use cases with the
advanced query parameters, e.g. if one wants to get an overview of a
longer history. This applies to both the index dashboard and group
overview page.

Example to show up to three week old builds instead of the default two
weeks with up to 20 builds instead of up to 10 being the default for the
group overview page:

....
http://openqa/group_overview/1?time_limit_days=21&limit_builds=20
....


=== Web UI controls to filter only tagged or all builds https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/807[gh#807]

Using a new query parameter `only_tagged=[0|1]' the list can be
filtered, e.g. show only tagged (important) builds.

Example screenshot:

image::images/job_group-limit_builds_tagged.png[Show only tagged or all builds]

Related issue: https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/11052[#11052]


=== Carry over bugrefs from previous jobs in same scenario if still failing https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA/pull/564[gh#564]

It is possible to label all failing tests but tedious to do by a human
user as many failures are just having the same issue until it gets
fixed. It helps if a label is preserved for a build that is still
failing. This idea is inspired by
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Claim+plugin and has been
activated for bugrefs.

Does not carry over bugrefs over passes: After a job passed a new issue
in a subsequent fail is assumed to be failed for a different reason.

Related issue: https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/10212[#10212]


=== Pinning comments as group description

This is possible by adding the keyword `pinned-description` anywhere in
a comment on the group overview page. Then the comment will be shown at
the top of the group overview page. However, it only works as operator
or admin.


== Asset cleanup ==

For more information on assets, see 'Asset handling' below.

Assets like ISO files consume a huge amount of disk space. Therefore openQA
removes assets automatically according to configurable limits.

This section provides an overall description of the cleanup strategy and
how to configure the limits. Cleanup-related parameter for the REST API can
be found in the 'Asset handling' section under 'Use of the REST API'.

=== Cleanup strategy ===

openQA frequently checks whether assets need to be removed according to
the configured limits.

To find out whether an asset should be removed, openQA determines by which
job groups the asset is used. If at least one job within a certain job group
is using an asset, the asset is considered to be used by that group.

So an asset can be accounted to multiple groups. The assets table which is
accessible via the admin menu shows these groups for each asset and also
the latest job.

If the size limit for assets by a certain group is exceeded, openQA will
remove assets accounted to that group:

* Assets belonging to old jobs are preferred.
* Assets belonging to jobs which are still scheduled or running are not
  considered.
* Assets which are also accounted to another group that has still space
  left are not considered.

Assets which do _not_ belong to any group are removed after a configurable
duration. Keep in mind that this behavior is also enabled on local instances
and affects all cloned jobs (unless cloned into a job group).

'Fixed' assets - those placed in the +fixed+ subdirectory of the relevant
asset directory - are counted against the group size limit, but are never
cleaned up. This is intended for things like base disk images which must
always be available for a test to work.

=== Configure limit for assets within groups ===

To configure the maximum size for the assets of a group, open 'Job groups'
in the operators menu and select a group. The size limit for assets can be
configured under 'Edit job group properties'. It also shows the size of
assets which belong to that group and not to any other group.

Job groups inherit the size limit from their parent group unless the limit
is set explicitely. The default size limit for groups can be adjusted in
the +default_group_limits+ section of the openQA config file.

=== Configure limit for groupless assets ===

Assets not belonging to jobs within a group are deleted automatically
after a certain number of days. That duration can be adjusted by setting
+untracked_assets_storage_duration+ in the +misc_limits+ section of the
openQA config to the desired number of days.


== Use of the REST API

openQA includes a _client_ script which - depending on the distribution - is
packaged independantly if you just want to interface with an existing openQA
instance without needing to install the full package. Call
`<openqa-folder>/script/client --help` for help (openSUSE: `openqa-client
--help`).

Basics are described in the
<<GettingStarted.asciidoc#gettingstarted,Getting Started>> guide.


=== Triggering tests

Tests can be triggered over multiple ways, using `openqa-clone-job`,
`jobs post`, `isos post` as well as retriggering existing jobs or whole media
over the web UI.


==== Cloning existing jobs - openqa-clone-job ====

If one wants to recreate an existing job from any publically available openQA
instance the script `openqa-clone-job` can be used to copy the necessary
settings and assets to another instance and schedule the test. For the test to
be executed it has to be ensured that matching ressources can be found, for
example a worker with matching `WORKER_CLASS` must be registered. More details
on `openqa-clone-job` can be found in
<<WritingTests.asciidoc#writingtests,Writing Tests>>.


==== Spawning single new jobs - jobs post ====

Single jobs can be spawned using the `jobs post` API route. All necessary
settings on a job must be supplied in the API request. The "openQA client" has
examples for this.


==== Spawning multiple jobs based on templates - isos post ====

The most common way of spawning jobs on production instances is using the
`isos post` API route. Based on previously defined settings for media, job
groups, machines and test suites jobs are triggered based on template
matching. The <<GettingStarted.asciidoc#gettingstarted,Getting Started>> guide already
mentioned examples. Additionally to the necessary template matching parameters
more parameters can be specified which are forwarded to all triggered jobs.
There are also special parameters which only have an influence on the way the
triggering itself is done. These parameters all start with a leading
underscore but are set as request parameters in the same way as the other
parameters.

[horizontal]
.The following scheduling parameters exist

_NO_OBSOLETE:: Do not obsolete jobs in older builds with same DISTRI and VERSION
(as is the default behavior). With this option jobs which are currently pending,
for example scheduled or running, are not cancelled when a new medium is triggered.

_DEPRIORITIZEBUILD:: Setting this switch '1' will not immediately obsolete jobs of old
builds but rather deprioritize them up to a configurable limit of priority.

_DEPRIORITIZE_LIMIT:: The configurable limit of priority up to which jobs
should be deprioritized. Needs `_DEPRIORITIZEBUILD`. Default 100.

_ONLY_OBSOLETE_SAME_BUILD:: Only obsolete (or deprioritize) jobs for the same BUILD.
This is useful for cases where a new build appearing does not necessarily
mean existing jobs for earlier builds with the same DISTRI and VERSION are
no longer interesting, but you still want to be able to re-submit jobs for a
build and have existing jobs for the exact same build obsoleted.

_GROUP:: Job templates *not* matching the given group name are ignored. Does *not*
         affect obsoletion behavior, so you might want to combine with `_NO_OBSOLETE`.

_GROUP_ID:: Same as `_GROUP` but allows to specify the group directly by ID.
_PRIORITY:: Sets the priority for the new jobs (which otherwise defaults to the priority
            of the job template)

Example for `_DEPRIORITIZEBUILD` and `_DEPRIORITIZE_LIMIT`.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
openqa-client isos post ISO=my_iso.iso DISTRI=my_distri FLAVOR=sweet \
         ARCH=my_arch VERSION=42 BUILD=1234 \
         _DEPRIORITIZEBUILD=1 _DEPRIORITIZE_LIMIT=120 \
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==== Asset handling ====

Multiple parameters exist to reference "assets" to be used by tests. "Assets" are essentially
content that is stored by the openQA web-UI and provided to the workers; when sending jobs to
os-autoinst on the workers, openQA adjusts the parameter values to refer to an absolute path
where the worker will be able to access the content. Things that are typically assets include the
ISOs and other images that are tested, for example.

Some assets can also be produced by a job, sent back to the web-UI, and used by a later job (see
explanation of 'storing' and 'publishing' assets, below). Assets can also be seen in the web-UI
and downloaded directly (though there is a configuration option to hide some or all asset types
from public view in the web-UI).

The parameters treated as assets are as follows. Where you see e.g. `ISO_n`, that means `ISO_1`,
`ISO_2` etc. will all be treated as assets.

* `ISO` (type `iso`)
* `ISO_n` (type `iso`)
* `HDD_n` (type `hdd`)
* `UEFI_PFLASH_VARS` (type `hdd`) (in some cases, see below)
* `REPO_n` (type `repo`)
* `ASSET_n` (type `other`)
* `KERNEL` (type `other`)
* `INITRD` (type `other`)

The values of the above parameters are expected to be the name of a file - or, in the case of
`REPO_n`, a directory - that exists under the path +/var/lib/openqa/share/factory+ on the openQA
web-UI. That path has subdirectories for each of the asset types, and the file or directory must
be in the correct subdirectory, so e.g. the file for an asset `HDD_1` must be under
+/var/lib/openqa/share/factory/hdd+. You may create a subdirectory called +fixed+ for any asset
type and place assets there (e.g. in +/var/lib/openqa/share/factory/hdd/fixed+ for `hdd`-type
assets): this exempts them from the automatic cleanup described under 'Asset cleanup' above.
Non-fixed assets are always subject to the cleanup.

`UEFI_PFLASH_VARS` is a special case: whether it is treated as an asset depends on the value. If
the value looks like an absolute path (starts with `/`), it will not be treated as an asset (and
so the value should be an absolute path for a file which exists on the relevant worker system(s)).
Otherwise, it is treated as an `hdd`-type asset. This allows tests to use a stock base image
(like the ones provided by edk2) for a simple case, but also allows a job to upload its image on
completion - including any changes made to the UEFI variables during the execution of the job -
for use by a child job which needs to inherit those changes.

You can also use special suffixes to the basic parameter forms to access some special handling for
assets.

[horizontal]
.The following suffixes exist:

_URL:: Before starting these jobs, try to download these assets into the relevant asset directory
of the openQA web-UI from trusted domains specified in +/etc/openqa/openqa.ini+. For e.g.,
`ISO_1_URL=http://trusted.com/foo.iso` would, if `trusted.com` is set as a trusted domain, cause
openQA to download the file `foo.iso` to +/var/lib/openqa/share/factory/iso+ and set
`ISO_1=foo.iso`. If you set both `ISO_1` and `ISO_1_URL`, the file pointed to by `ISO_1_URL` will
be downloaded and renamed to the name set as `ISO_1`.

_DECOMPRESS_URL:: Specify a compressed asset to be downloaded that will be uncompressed by openQA.
For e.g. `ISO_1_DECOMPRESS_URL=http://host/foo2.iso.xz` will download the file `foo2.iso.xz`,
uncompress it to `foo2.iso`, store it in +/var/lib/openqa/share/factory/iso+ and set
`ISO_1=foo2.iso`. Again, you can also set `ISO_1` to change the name the file will be downloaded
and uncompressed as.

Assets may be shared between the web-UI and the workers by having them literally use a shared
filesystem (this used to be the only option), or by having the workers download them from the
server when needed and cache them locally. See 'Asset Caching' in the<<Installing.asciidoc,Installing>>
guide for more on this.

`HDD_n` assets can be 'stored' or 'published' by a job, and `UEFI_PFLASH_VARS` assets can be
'published'. These both mean that if the job completes successfully, the resulting state of those
disk assets will be sent back to the web-UI and made available as an `hdd`-type asset. To 'store'
an asset, you can specify e.g. `STORE_HDD_1`. To 'publish' it, you can specify e.g.
`PUBLISH_HDD_1` or `PUBLISH_PFLASH_VARS`. If you specify `PUBLISH_HDD_1=updated.qcow2`, the
`HDD_1` disk image as it exists at the end of the test will be uploaded back to the web-UI and
stored under the name `updated.qcow2`; any other job can then specify `HDD_1=updated.qcow2` to use
this published image as its `HDD_1`.

The difference between 'storing' and 'publishing' is that when 'storing' an asset, it will be
altered in some way (currently, by prepending the job ID to the filename) to associate it with
the particular job that produced it. That means that many jobs can 'store' an asset under "the
same name" without conflicting. Of course, that would seem to make it hard for other jobs to use
the 'stored' image - but for "chained" jobs, the reverse operation is done transparently. This
all means that a 'parent' job template can specify `STORE_HDD_1=somename.qcow2` and its 'child'
job template(s) can specify `HDD_1=somename.qcow2`, and everything will work, without multiple
runs of the same jobs overwriting the asset. For more on "chained" jobs, see  'Job dependencies'
in the <<WritingTests.asciidoc,Writing Tests>> guide.

When using this mechanism you will often also want to use the 'Variable expansion' mechanism
described in the <<GettingStarted.asciidoc,Getting Started>> guide.

== Developer mode ==

The developer mode allows to:

* Create or update needles from +assert_screen+ mismatches ("re-needling")
* Pause the test execution (at a certain module) for manual investigation of the SUT

It can be accessed via the "Live View" tab of a running test. Only registered
users can take control over a tests. Basic instructions and buttons providing further
information about the different options are already contained on the web page itself.
So I am not repeating that information here and rather explain the overall workflow.

In case the developer mode in not working on your instance, try to follow the
<<Pitfalls.asciidoc#debugdevelmode,steps for debugging the developer mode under 'Pitfalls'>>.

=== Workflow for creating or updating needles ===

1. In case a new needles should be created, add the corresponding +assert_screen+s to
   your test.
2. Start the test with the +assert_screen+s which are supposed to fail.
3. Select "Pause on +assert_screen+ failure and confirm.
4. Wait until the test has paused. There is a button to skip the current timeout to speed
   this up.
5. A button for acessing the needle editor should occour. It may take a few seconds till
   it occurs because the screenshots created so far need to be uploaded from the worker to
   the web UI. Of course it is also possible to go back to the "Details" tab to create a new
   needle from any previous screenshot/match available.
6. After creating the new needle, click the resume button to test whether it worked.

Steps 4. to 6. can be repeated for further +assert_screen+s/needles without restarting the
test.

== Where to now?

For test developers it is recommended to continue with the
<<WritingTests.asciidoc#writingtests,Test Developer Guide>>.
