Needle editing
==============

- if a new needle is created based on a failed test the new needle
  will not be listed in old tests.
- if an existing needle is updated with a new image or different
  areas old test will display the new needle which might be
  confusing
- if a needle is deleted old tests may display an error when viewing
  them in the web UI.
