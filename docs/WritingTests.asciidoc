== Introduction

openQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It's free software released
under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GPLv2 license]. The
source code and documentation are hosted in the
https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst organization on GitHub].

This document provides the information needed to start developing new tests for
openQA or to improve the existing ones. It's
assumed that the reader is already familiar with openQA and has already read the
Starter Guide, available at the
https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[official repository].

== Basic
[id="basic"]

This section explains the basic layout of openQA tests and the API available in tests.
openQA tests are written in the *Perl* programming language. Some basic but no
in-depth knowledge of Perl is needed. This document assumes that the reader
is already familiar with Perl.

== API
[id="api"]
:testapi: https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/blob/master/testapi.pm[os-autoinst]

{testapi} provides the API for the tests using the os-autoinst backend, you can
take a look to the published documentation at http://open.qa/api/testapi/. This test API
is sometimes also referred to as an openQA DSL, because in some contexts it can look like
a domain specific language.

== How to write tests

openQA tests need to implement at least the *run* subroutine to
contain the actual test code and the test needs to be loaded in the distribution's
main.pm.

The *test_flags* subroutine specifies what should happen when test execution of the
current test module is finished depending on the result.
If we should skip execution of the following test modules if current one failed, or it
should be used to create a snapshot of the SUT to rollback to. The following flags
are supported:

* *fatal*: The whole test suite is aborted if the test module fails. The overall state
  is set to `failed`.
* *ignore_failure*: If this module fails, it will not affect the overall result at all.
* *milestone*: After this test succeeds, update the 'lastgood' snapshot.
* *no_rollback*: Don't roll back to the 'lastgood' snapshot if the test module fails.
* *always_rollback*: Roll back to the 'lastgood' snapshot even if test was successful.

See the example below for how to enable a test flag.
Note that snapshots are only supported by the QEMU backend. When using other backends
`fatal` is therefore enabled by default. One can explicitly set it to `0` to disable
the behavior for all backends even though it is not possible to roll back.

There are several callbacks defined:

* *post_fail_hook* is called to upload log files or determine the state of
  the machine
* *pre_run_hook* is called before the run function - mainly useful for a whole
  group of tests
* *post_run_hook* is run after successful run function - mainly useful for a whole
  group of tests

The following example is a basic test that assumes some live image
that boots into the desktop when pressing enter at the boot loader:

[source,perl]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
use Mojo::Base "basetest";
use testapi;

sub run {
    # wait for bootloader to appear
    # with a timeout explicitly lower than the default because
    # the bootloader screen will timeout itself
    assert_screen "bootloader", 15;

    # press enter to boot right away
    send_key "ret";

    # wait for the desktop to appear
    assert_screen "desktop", 300;
}

sub test_flags {
    return {fatal => 1};
}

    # quit kate
    send_key 'ctrl-q';

    # make sure kate was closed

}
--------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to Perl, it is possible to write tests in Python. Although the
boilerplate is slightly different the function names are the same.

    assert_screen('openqa-search-results')


def switch_to_root_console():
    send_key('ctrl-alt-f3')


def post_fail_hook(self):
    switch_to_root_console()
    assert_script_run('openqa-cli api experimental/search q=shutdown.pm')


def test_flags(self):
    return {'fatal': 1}
--------------------------------------------------------------

== Variables

Test case behavior can be controlled via variables. Some basic
variables like `DISTRI`, `VERSION`, `ARCH` are always set.
Others like `DESKTOP` are defined by the 'Test suites' in the openQA
web UI.
Check the existing tests at
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse
on GitHub] for examples.

Variables are accessible via the *get_var* and *check_var* functions.

== Advanced test features

=== Changing timeouts

By default, tests are aborted after two hours by the worker. To change this
limit, set the test variable `MAX_JOB_TIME` to the desired number of seconds.

The download of assets, synchronization of tests and other setup tasks do *not*
count into `MAX_JOB_TIME`. However, the setup time is limited by default to one
hour. This can be changed by setting `MAX_SETUP_TIME`.

To save disk space, increasing `MAX_JOB_TIME` beyond the default will
automatically disable the video by adding `NOVIDEO=1` to the test settings.
This can be prevented by adding `NOVIDEO=0` explicitly.

The variable `TIMEOUT_SCALE` allows to scale `MAX_JOB_TIME` and timeouts
within the backend, for example the <<_api,test API>>. This is supposed to
be set within the worker settings on slow worker hosts. It has no influence on
the video setting.

=== Capturing kernel exceptions and/or any other exceptions from the serial console

Soft and hard failures can be triggered on demand by regular expressions when they match the
serial output which is done after the test is executed. In case it does not make sense
to continue the test run even if the current test module does not have the fatal flag, use `fatal`
as serial failure type, so all subsequent test modules will not be executed if such failure
was detected.

To use this functionality the test developer needs to define the patterns to
look for in the serial output either in the main.pm or in the test itself.
Any pattern change done in a test it will be reflected in the next tests.

The patterns defined in `main.pm` will be valid for all the tests.

To simplify tests results review, if job fails with the same message, which is defined
for the pattern, as previous job, automatic comment carryover will work even if
test suites have failed due to different test modules.

    push @$self->{serial_failures}, {type => 'soft', message => 'known issue',  pattern => quotemeta 'Error'};
    ...
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

=== Assigning jobs to workers

By default, any worker can get any job with the matching architecture.

This behavior can be changed by setting job variable WORKER_CLASS. Jobs
with this variable set (typically via machines or test suites configuration) are
assigned only to workers, which have the same variable in the configuration file.

For example, the following configuration ensures, that jobs with WORKER_CLASS=desktop
can be assigned _only_ to worker instances 1 and 2.

[caption="File: "]
.workers.ini
[source,ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]
WORKER_CLASS = desktop

[2]
WORKER_CLASS = desktop

[3]
# WORKER_CLASS is not set
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=== Running a custom worker engine

By default the openQA workers run the "isotovideo" application from PATH on
the worker host, that is in most cases
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/blob/master/isotovideo[isotovideo].
A custom worker engine command can be set with the test variable `ISOTOVIDEO`.
For example to run isotovideo from a custom container image one could use the
test variable setting
`ISOTOVIDEO=podman run --pull=always --rm -it registry.example.org/my/container/isotovideo /usr/bin/isotovideo -d`

=== Automatic retries of jobs

You might encounter flaky openQA tests that fail sporadically. The best way to
address flaky test code is of course to fix the test code itself. For example,
if certain steps rely on external components over network, retries within the
test modules should be applied.

However, there can still be cases where you might want openQA to automatically
retrigger jobs. This can be achieved by setting the test variable `RETRY` in the
format `<retries>[:<description>]` to an integer value with the maximum number
of retries and an optional description string separated by a colon. For example
triggering an openQA job with the variable `RETRY=2:bug#42` will retrigger an
openQA test on failure up to 2 totalling to up to 3 jobs. Note that the retry
jobs are scheduled immediately and will be executed as soon as possible
depending on available worker slots. Many factors can change in retries
impacting the reproducibility, e.g. the used worker host and instance, any
network related content, etc. By default openQA tests do not retry. The
optional, additional description string is used only for reference and has no
functional impact.

See <<Installing.asciidoc#automatic_cloning_incomplete_jobs,Automatic cloning of incomplete jobs>>
for an additional solution intended for administrators handling known issues
causing incomplete jobs.

<<Installing.asciidoc#custom_hook_scripts_job_done,Custom hook scripts on "job done" based on result>>
can be used to apply more elaborate issue detection and retriggering of tests.

=== Writing multi-machine tests
[id="mm-tests"]

Scenarios requiring more than one system under test (SUT), like High Availability testing, are covered as multi-machine tests (MM tests) in this section.

openQA approaches multi-machine testing by assigning dependencies between individual jobs. This means the following:

* _everything needed for MM tests must be running as a test job_ (or you are on your own), even support infrastructure (custom DHCP, NFS,
etc. if required), which in principle is not part of the actual testing, must have a defined test suite so a test job can be created
* openQA scheduler makes sure _tests are started as a group_ and in right order, _cancelled as a group_ if some dependencies are violated and _cloned as
a group_ if requested.
* openQA _does not synchronize_ individual steps of the tests.
* openQA provides _locking server for basic synchronization_ of tests (e.g. wait until services are ready for failover), but the _correct usage of locks is
test designer job_ (beware deadlocks).

In short, writing multi-machine tests adds a few more layers of complexity:

1. documenting the dependencies and order between individual tests
2. synchronization between individual tests
3. actual technical realization (i.e. <<Networking.asciidoc#networking,custom networking>>)

==== Job dependencies
There are different dependency *types*, most importantly _chained_ and
_parallel_ dependencies.

A dependency is always between two jobs where one of the jobs is the _parent_
and one the _child_. The concept of parent and child jobs is *orthogonal* to
the concept of types.

A job can have multiple dependencies. So in conclusion, a job can have multiple
children and multiple parents at the same time and each child/parent-relation
can be of an arbitrary type.

Additionally, dependencies can be machine-specific (see
<<WritingTests.asciidoc#_inter_machine_dependencies,Inter-machine dependencies>>
section).

===== Declaring dependencies
Dependencies are declared by adding a job setting on the child job specifying
its parents. There is one variable for each dependency type.

When starting jobs
<<UsersGuide.asciidoc#_spawning_multiple_jobs_based_on_templates_isos_post,based on templates>>
the relevant settings are `START_AFTER_TEST`, `START_DIRECTLY_AFTER_TEST` and
`PARALLEL_WITH`. Details are explained for the different dependency types
specifically in the subsequent sections. Generally, if declaring a dependency
does not work as expected, be sure to check the "scheduled product" for the jobs
(which is linked on the info box of the details page of any created job).

When starting a single set of new jobs, the dependencies must be declared as
explained in the
<<UsersGuide.asciidoc#_further_examples_for_advanced_dependency_handling,Further examples for advanced dependency handling>>
section. The variables mentioned in the subsequent sections do *not* apply.

====== Chained dependencies
_Chained_ dependencies declare that one test must only
run after another test has concluded. For instance, extra tests relying on a
successfully finished installation should declare a chained dependency on the
installation test.

There are also _directly-chained_ dependencies. They are similar to _chained_
dependencies but are strictly a distinct type. The difference between _chained_
and _directly-chained_ dependencies is that directly-chained means the tests
must run directly after another on the same worker slot. This can be useful to
test efficiently on bare metal SUTs and other self-provisioning environments.

Tests that are waiting for their _chained_ parents to finish are shown as
"blocked" in the web UI. Tests that are waiting for their _directly-chained_
parents to finish are shown as "assigned" in the web UI.

To declare a _chained_ dependency add the variable `START_AFTER_TEST` with the
name(s) of test suite(s) after which the selected test suite is supposed to run.
Use a comma-separated list for multiple test suite dependencies, e.g.
`START_AFTER_TEST="kde,dhcp-server"`.

To declare a _directly-chained_ dependency add the variable
`START_DIRECTLY_AFTER_TEST`. It works in the same way as for _chained_
dependencies. Mismatching worker classes between jobs to run in direct sequence
on the same worker are considered an error.

NOTE: The set of all jobs that have direct or indirect _directly-chained_
dependencies between each other is sometimes called a _directly-chained
cluster_. All jobs within the cluster will be assigned to a single worker-slot
at the same time by the scheduler.

====== Parallel dependencies
_Parallel_ dependencies declare that tests must be scheduled to run at the same
time. An example are "multi-machine tests" which usually test some kind of
server and multiple clients. In this example the client tests should declare a
parallel dependency on the server tests.

To declare a _parallel_ dependency, use the `PARALLEL_WITH` variable with the
name(s) of test suite(s) that need other test suite(s) to run at the same time.
In other words, `PARALLEL_WITH` declares "I need this test suite to be running
during my run". Use a comma separated list for multiple test suite dependencies
(e.g. `PARALLEL_WITH="web-server,dhcp-server"`).

Keep in mind that the parent job _must be running until all children finish_.
Otherwise the scheduler will cancel child jobs once parent is done.

NOTE: The set of all jobs that have direct or indirect _parallel_ dependencies
between each other is sometimes called a _parallel cluster_. The scheduler can
only assign these jobs if there is a sufficient number of free worker-slots. To
avoid a parallel cluster from starvation its priority is increased gradually and
eventually workers can be held back for the cluster.

===== Inter-machine dependencies
Those dependencies make it possible to create job dependencies between tests which are supposed to run on different machines.

To use it, simply append the machine name for each dependent test suite with an `@` sign separated.
If a machine is not explicitly defined, the variable `MACHINE` of the current job is used for the dependent test suite.

Example 1:

 START_AFTER_TEST="kde@64bit-1G,dhcp-server@64bit-8G"

Example 2:

 PARALLEL_WITH="web-server@ipmi-fly,dhcp-server@ipmi-bee,http-server"

Then, in job templates, add test suite(s) and all of its dependent test suite(s). Keep in mind to place the machines which
have been explicitly defined in a variable for each dependent test suite.
Checkout the following example sections to get a better understanding.

===== Handling of related jobs on failure / cancellation / restart
openQA tries to handle things sensibly when jobs with dependencies either fail, or are manually cancelled or restarted:

* When a chained or parallel parent fails or is cancelled, all children will be cancelled.
* When a parent is restarted, all children are also restarted recursively.
* When a parallel child is restarted, the parent and siblings will also be restarted.
* When a *regularly* chained child is restarted, the parent is only restarted if it failed. This will usually be fine, but be aware that if an asset uploaded by the chained parent has been cleaned up, the child may fail immediately. To deal with this case, just restart the parent to recreate the asset.
* When a *directly* chained child is restarted, all directly chained parents are recursively restarted (but not directly chained siblings). Otherwise it would not be possible to guarantee that the jobs run directly after each other on the same worker.
* When a parallel *child* fails or is cancelled, the parent and all other children are also cancelled. This behaviour is intended for closely-related clusters of jobs, e.g. high availability tests, where it's sensible to assume the entire test is invalid if any of its components fails. A special variable can be used to change this behaviour. Setting a parallel parent job's PARALLEL_CANCEL_WHOLE_CLUSTER to a false value, i.e. 0, changes this so that, if one of its children fails or is cancelled but the parent has other pending or active children, the parent and the other children will not be cancelled. This behaviour makes more sense if the parent is providing services to the various children but the children themselves are not closely related and a failure of one does not imply that the tests run by the other children and the parent are invalid.

====== Further notes
* The API also allows to skip restarting parents via `skip_parents=1` and to skip restarting children via `skip_children=1`. It is also possible to skip restarting only passed and softfailed children via `skip_ok_result_children=1`.
* Restarting multiple directly chained children individually is not possible because the parent would be restarted twice which is not possible. So one needs to restart the parent job instead. Use the mentioned `skip_ok_result_children=1` to restart only jobs which are not ok.

===== Handling of dependencies when cloning jobs
Be sure to have ready the <<WritingTests.asciidoc#_job_dependencies,job
dependencies>> section to have an understanding of different dependency types
and the distinction between parents and children.

When cloning a job via `openqa-clone-job`, parent jobs are cloned as well by
default, regardless of the type. Use `--skip-deps` to avoid cloning parent jobs.
Use `--skip-chained-deps` to avoid cloning parents of the types `CHAINED` and
`DIRECTLY_CHAINED`.

When cloning a job via `openqa-clone-job`, child jobs of the type `PARALLEL` are
cloned by default. Use `--clone-children` to clone child jobs of other types as
well. By default, only direct children are considered (regardless of the type).
Use `--max-depth` to specify a higher depth (`0` denotes infinity). Be aware
that this affects siblings as well when cloning parents (as explained in the
previous paragraph).

As a consequence it makes a difference which job of the dependency tree
is cloned, especially with default parameters. Examples:

* Cloning a _chained child_ (e.g. an "extra" test) will clone its parents (e.g.
an "installation" test) as well but *not* vice versa.
* To clone a parallel cluster, the _parallel parent_ should be cloned (e.g. the
"server" test). When cloning a parallel child, only _that_ child and the parent
will be cloned but not the siblings (e.g. the other "client" tests).

===== Examples
====== Specify machine explicitly
Assume there is a test suite `A` supposed to run on machine `64bit-8G`. Additionally, test suite `B` supposed to run on machine `64bit-1G`.
That means test suite `B` needs the variable `START_AFTER_TEST=A@64bit-8G`. This results in the following dependency:
----
A@64bit-8G --> B@64bit-1G
----

====== Implicitly inherit machines from parent
Assume test suite `A` is supposed to run on the machines `64bit` and `ppc`. Additionally, test suite `B` is supposed to run on both of these
machines as well. This can be achieved by simply adding the variable `START_AFTER_TEST=A` to test suite `B` (omitting the machine at all).
openQA take the best matches. This results in the following dependencies:

----
A@64bit --> B@64bit
A@ppc --> B@ppc
----

====== Conflicting machines prevent inheritance from parent
Assume test suite `A` is supposed to run on machine `64bit-8G`. Additionally, test suite `B` is supposed to run on machine `64bit-1G`.

Adding the variable `START_AFTER_TEST=A` to test suite `B` will *not* work. That means openQA will *not* create a job dependency and instead shows
an error message. So it is required to explicitly define the variable as `START_AFTER_TEST=A@64bit-8G` in that case.

Consider a different example: Assume test suite `A` is supposed to run on the machines `ppc`, `64bit` and `s390x`. Additionally, there are 3
testsuites `B` on `ppc-1G`, `C` on `ppc-2G` and `D` on `ppc64le`.

Adding the variable `PARALLEL_WITH=A@ppc` to the test suites `B`, `C` and `D` will result in the following dependencies:

----
            A@ppc
              ^
           /  |  \
         /    |    \
B@ppc-1G  C@ppc-2G  D@ppc64le
----

openQA will also show errors that test suite `A` is not necessary on the machines `64bit` and `s390x`.

====== Implicitly creating a dependency on same machine
Assume the value of the variable `START_AFTER_TEST` or `PARALLEL_WITH` *only* contains a test suite name but no
machine (e.g. `START_AFTER_TEST=A,B` or `PARALLEL_WITH=A,B`).

In this case openQA will create job dependencies that are scheduled on the same machine if all test suites are placed on the same machine.

===== Notes regarding directly chained dependencies
Having multiple jobs with `START_DIRECTLY_AFTER_TEST` pointing to the same parent job is possible, e.g.:
----
   --> B --> C
 /
A
 \
   --> D --> E
----

Of course only either `B` or `D` jobs can really be started *directly* after `A`. However, the use of `START_DIRECTLY_AFTER_TEST` still makes sure that no completely different job is executed in the middle and of course that all of these jobs are executed on the same worker.

The directly chained sub-trees are executed in alphabetical order. So the above tree would result in the following execution order: `A, B, C, D, E`.

If `A` fails, none of the other jobs are attempted to be executed. If `B` fails, `C` is not attempted to be executed but `D` and `E` are. The assumption is that the average error case does not leave the system in a completely broken state and possibly required cleanup is done in the post fail hook.

Directly chained dependencies and regularly chained dependencies can be mixed. This allows to create a dependency tree which contains multiple directly chained sub-trees. Be aware that these sub-trees might be executed on *different* workers and depending on the tree even be executed in parallel.

===== Worker requirements
`CHAINED` and `DIRECTLY_CHAINED` dependencies require only one worker. `PARALLEL` dependencies on the other hand require as many free workers as jobs are present in the
parallel cluster.

====== Examples

.`CHAINED` - i.e. test basic functionality before going advanced - requires 1 worker
----
A --> B --> C

Define test suite A,
then define B with variable START_AFTER_TEST=A and then define C with START_AFTER_TEST=B

-or-

Define test suite A, B
and then define C with START_AFTER_TEST=A,B
In this case however the start order of A and B is not specified.
But C will start only after A and B are successfully done.
----
.`PARALLEL` basic High-Availability
----
A
^
B

Define test suite A
and then define B with variable PARALLEL_WITH=A.
A in this case is parent test suite to B and must be running throughout B run.
----
.`PARALLEL` with multiple parents - i.e. complex support requirements for one test - requires 4 workers
----
A B C
\ | /
  ^
  D

Define test suites A,B,C
and then define D with PARALLEL_WITH=A,B,C.
A,B,C run in parallel and are parent test suites for D and all must run until D finish.
----
.`PARALLEL` with one parent - i.e. running independent tests against one server - requires at least 2 workers
----
   A
   ^
  /|\
 B C D

Define test suite A
and then define B,C,D with PARALLEL_WITH=A
A is parent test suite for B, C, D (all can run in parallel).
Children B, C, D can run and finish anytime, but A must run until all B, C, D finishes.
----

=== Test synchronization and locking API

openQA provides a locking API. To use it in your test files import the `lockapi` package (_use lockapi;_). It provides the following functions: `mutex_create`, `mutex_lock`, `mutex_unlock`, `mutex_wait`

Each of these functions takes the name of the mutex lock as first parameter. The name must not contain the "-" character. Mutex locks are associated with the caller's job.

`mutex_lock` tries to lock the mutex for the caller's job. The `mutex_lock` call blocks if the mutex does not exist or has been locked by a different job.

`mutex_unlock` tries to unlock the mutex. If the mutex is locked by a different job, `mutex_unlock` call blocks until the lock becomes available. If the mutex does not exist the call returns immediately without doing anything.

`mutex_wait` is a combination of `mutex_lock` and `mutex_unlock`. It displays more information about mutex state (time spent waiting, location of the lock). Use it if you need to wait for a specific action from single place (e.g. that Apache is running on the master node).

`mutex_create` creates a new mutex which is initially unlocked. If the mutex already exists the call returns immediately without doing anything.

Mutexes are addressed by _their name_. Each cluster of parallel jobs (defined via `PARALLEL_WITH` dependencies) has its own namespace. That means concurrently running jobs in different parallel job clusters use distinct mutexes (even if the same names are used).

The `mmapi` package provides `wait_for_children` which the parent can use to wait for the children to complete.

sub run {
    # wait until ftp service is ready
    mutex_lock 'ftp_service_ready';

    # Perform operation with exclusive access
    script_run 'ftp parent.job.ip';
    script_run 'put only_i_am_here';
    script_run 'bye';

    # Allow other jobs to connect afterwards
    mutex_unlock 'ftp_service_ready';
}

Sometimes it is useful to wait for a certain action from the child or sibling job rather than the parent.
In this case the child or sibling will create a mutex and any cluster job can lock/unlock it.

The child can however die at any time. To prevent parent deadlock in this situation,
it is required to pass the mutex owner's job ID as a second parameter to `mutex_lock` and `mutex_wait`.
The mutex owner is the job that creates the mutex.
If a child job with a given ID has already finished, `mutex_lock` calls die.
The job ID is also required when unlocking such a mutex.

.Wait until the child reaches given point
====
[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use lockapi;
use mmapi;

sub run {
    my $children = get_children();

    # let's suppose there is only one child
    my $child_id = (keys %$children)[0];

    # this blocks until the lock is available and then does nothing
    mutex_wait('child_reached_given_point', $child_id);

    # continue with the test
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====


Mutexes are a way to wait for specific events from a single job.
When we need multiple jobs to reach a certain state we need to use barriers.

To create a barrier call `barrier_create` with the parameters name and count.
The name serves as an ID (same as with mutexes). The count parameter specifies the
number of jobs needed to call `barrier_wait` to unlock barrier.

There is an optional `barrier_wait` parameter called `check_dead_job`.
When used it will kill all jobs waiting in `barrier_wait` if one of the cluster jobs
dies. It prevents waiting for states that will never be reached (and eventually dies
on job timeout). It should be set only on one of the `barrier_wait` calls.

An example would be one master and three worker jobs and you want to do initial setup
in the three worker jobs before starting main actions. In such a case you might use
`check_dead_job` to avoid useless actions when one of the worker jobs dies.


[caption="Example of barriers: "]
.Check for dead jobs while waiting for barrier
====
[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use lockapi;

# In main.pm
barrier_create('NODES_CONFIGURED', 4);

# On master job
sub run {
    assert_screen 'login', 300;

    # Master is ready, waiting while workers are configured (check_dead_job is optional)
    barrier_wait {name => "NODES_CONFIGURED", check_dead_job => 1};

    # When 4 jobs called barrier_wait they are all unblocked
    script_run 'create_cluster';
    script_run 'test_cluster';

    # Notify all nodes that we are finished
    mutex_create 'CLUSTER_CREATED';
    wait_for_children;
}

# On 3 worker jobs
sub run {
    assert_screen 'login', 300;

    # do initial worker setup
    script_run 'zypper in HA';
    script_run 'echo IP > /etc/HA/node_setup';

    # Join the group of jobs waiting for each other
    barrier_wait 'NODES_CONFIGURED';

    # Don't finish until cluster is created & tested
    mutex_wait 'CLUSTER_CREATED';

=== Support Server based tests

The idea is to have a dedicated "helper server" to allow advanced network based testing.

Support server takes advantage of the basic parallel setup as described in the previous section, with the support server being the parent test 'A' and the test needing it being the child test 'B'. This ensures that the test 'B' always have the support server available.

==== Preparing the supportserver


The support server image is created by calling a special test, based on the autoyast test:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/share/openqa/script/client jobs post DISTRI=opensuse VERSION=13.2 \
    ISO=openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso  ARCH=x86_64 FLAVOR=Server-DVD \
    TEST=supportserver_generator MACHINE=64bit DESKTOP=textmode  INSTALLONLY=1 \
    AUTOYAST=supportserver/autoyast_supportserver.xml SUPPORT_SERVER_GENERATOR=1 \
    PUBLISH_HDD_1=supportserver.qcow2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This produces QEMU image 'supportserver.qcow2' that contains the supportserver. The 'autoyast_supportserver.xml'
should define correct user and password, as well as packages and the common configuration.

More specific role the supportserver should take is then selected when the server is run in the actual test scenario.

==== Using the supportserver


In the Test suites, the supportserver is defined by setting:

[source,ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HDD_1=supportserver.qcow2
SUPPORT_SERVER=1
SUPPORT_SERVER_ROLES=pxe,qemuproxy
WORKER_CLASS=server,qemu_autoyast_tap_64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

where the `SUPPORT_SERVER_ROLES` defines the specific role (see code in 'tests/support_server/setup.pm' for available roles and their definition), and
 `HDD_1` variable must be the name of the supportserver image as defined via `PUBLISH_HDD_1` variable during supportserver generation. If the support
server is based on older SUSE versions (opensuse 11.x, SLE11SP4..) it may also be needed to add `HDDMODEL=virtio-blk`. In case of QEMU backend, one can
also use `BOOTFROM=c`, for faster boot directly from the `HDD_1` image.

Then for the 'child' test using this supportserver, the following additional variable must be set:
`PARALLEL_WITH=supportserver-pxe-tftp`
where 'supportserver-pxe-tftp' is the name given to the supportserver in the test suites screen.
Once the tests are defined, they can be added to openQA in the usual way:

[source,sh]
-----------------
/usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post DISTRI=opensuse VERSION=13.2 \
        ISO=openSUSE-13.2-DVD-x86_64.iso ARCH=x86_64 FLAVOR=Server-DVD
-----------------

where the `DISTRI`, `VERSION`, `FLAVOR` and `ARCH` correspond to the job group containing the tests.
Note that the networking is provided by tap devices, so both jobs should run on machines defined by (apart from others) having `NICTYPE=tap`, `WORKER_CLASS=qemu_autoyast_tap_64`.


[caption="Example of Support Server: "]
.a simple tftp test
====

Let's assume that we want to test tftp client operation. For this, we setup the supportserver as a tftp server:
[source,ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HDD_1=supportserver.qcow2
SUPPORT_SERVER=1
SUPPORT_SERVER_ROLES=dhcp,tftp
WORKER_CLASS=server,qemu_autoyast_tap_64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====

With a test-suites name `supportserver-opensuse-tftp`.

The actual test 'child' job, will then have to set `PARALLEL_WITH=supportserver-opensuse-tftp`, and also other variables according to the test requirements. For convenience, we have also started a dhcp server on the supportserver, but even without it, network could be set up manually by assigning a free ip address (e.g. 10.0.2.15) on the system of the test job.

[caption="Example of Support Server: "]
.The code in the *.pm module doing the actual tftp test could then look something like the example below
====
[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use Mojo::Base 'basetest';
use testapi;

sub run {
  my $script="set -e -x\n";
  $script.="echo test >test.txt\n";
  $script.="time tftp ".$server_ip." -c put test.txt test2.txt\n";
  $script.="time tftp ".$server_ip." -c get test2.txt\n";
  $script.="diff -u test.txt test2.txt\n";
  script_output($script);

}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====

assuming of course, that the tested machine was already set up with necessary infrastructure for tftp, e.g. network was set up, tftp rpm installed and tftp service started, etc. All of this could be conveniently achieved using the autoyast installation, as shown in the next section.


[caption="Example of Support Server: "]
.autoyast based tftp test
====

Here we will use autoyast to setup the system of the test job and the os-autoinst autoyast testing infrastructure. For supportserver, this means using proxy to access QEMU provided data, for downloading autoyast profile and tftp verify script:

[source,ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HDD_1=supportserver.qcow2
SUPPORT_SERVER=1
SUPPORT_SERVER_ROLES=pxe,qemuproxy
WORKER_CLASS=server,qemu_autoyast_tap_64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The actual test 'child' job, will then be defined as :

[source,ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOYAST=autoyast_opensuse/opensuse_autoyast_tftp.xml
AUTOYAST_VERIFY=autoyast_opensuse/opensuse_autoyast_tftp.sh
DESKTOP=textmode
INSTALLONLY=1
PARALLEL_WITH=supportserver-opensuse-tftp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
====

again assuming the support server's name being `supportserver-opensuse-tftp`. Note that the `pxe` role already contains `tftp` and `dhcp` server role, since they are needed for the pxe boot to work.

[caption="Example of Support Server: "]
.The tftp test defined in the `autoyast_opensuse/opensuse_autoyast_tftp.sh` file could be something like:
====
[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
set -e -x
echo test >test.txt
time tftp #SERVER_URL# -c put test.txt test2.txt
time tftp #SERVER_URL# -c get test2.txt
diff -u test.txt test2.txt && echo "AUTOYAST OK"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the rest is done automatically, using already prepared test modules in `tests/autoyast` subdirectory.
====

=== Using text consoles and the serial terminal

Typically the OS you are testing will boot into a graphical shell e.g. The
Gnome desktop environment. This is fine if you wish to test a program with a
GUI, but in many situations you will need to enter commands into a textual
shell (e.g Bash), TTY, text terminal, command prompt, TUI etc.

openQA has two basic methods for interacting with a text shell. The first uses
the same input and output methods as when interacting with a GUI, plus a
serial port for getting raw text output from the SUT. This is primarily
implemented with VNC and so I will referrer to it as the VNC text console.

The serial port device which is used with the VNC text console is the default
virtual serial port device in QEMU (i.e. the device configured with the
`-serial` command line option). I will refer to this as the "default serial
port". openQA currently only uses this serial port for one way communication
from the SUT to the host.

The second method uses another serial port for both input and output. The SUT
attaches a TTY to the serial port which os-autoinst logs into. All
communication is therefore text based, similar to if you SSH'd into a remote
machine. This is called the serial terminal console (or the virtio console,
see implementation section for details).

The VNC text console is very slow and expensive relative to the serial
terminal console, but allows you to continue using `assert_screen` and is more
widely supported. Below is an example of how to use the VNC text console.

[caption="Switching to text mode: "]
.To access a text based console or TTY, you can do something like the
following.
====
[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
use 5.018;
use Mojo::Base 'opensusebasetest';
use testapi;
use utils;

sub run {
    wait_boot;  # Utility function defined by the SUSE distribution
    select_console 'root-console';
}

1;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will select a text TTY and login as the root user (if necessary). Now
that we are on a text console it is possible to run scripts and observe their
output either as raw text or on the video feed.

Note that `root-console` is defined by the distribution, so on different
distributions or operating systems this can vary. There are also many utility
functions that wrap `select_console`, so check your distribution's utility
library before using it directly.

====

[caption="Running a script: "]
.Using the `assert_script_run` and `script_output` commands
====
[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assert_script_run('cd /proc');
my $cpuinfo = script_output('cat cpuinfo');
if($cpuinfo =~ m/avx2/) {
    # Do something which needs avx2
}
else {
    # Do some workaround
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This returns the contents of the SUT's /proc/cpuinfo file to the test script
and then searches it for the term 'avx2' using a regex.

====

The `script_run` and `script_output` are high level commands which use
`type_string` and `wait_serial` underneath. Sometimes you may wish to use
lower level commands which give you more control, but be warned that it may
also make your code less portable.

The command `wait_serial` watches the SUT's serial port for text output and
matches it against a regex. `type_string` sends a string to the SUT like it
was typed in by the user over VNC.

==== Using a serial terminal

IMPORTANT: You need a QEMU version >= 2.6.1 and to set the
`VIRTIO_CONSOLE` variable to 1 to use this with the QEMU backend
(it is enabled by default for
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse]
tests). The svirt backend uses the `SERIAL_CONSOLE` variable, but only on s390x
machines it has been confirmed to be working (failing on Hyper-V, VMware and
XEN, see https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/55985[poo#55985]).

Usually openQA controls the system under test using VNC. This allows the use
of both graphical and text based consoles. Key presses are sent individually
as VNC commands and output is returned in the form of screen images and text
output from the SUT's default serial port.

Sending key presses over VNC is very slow, so for tests which send a lot of
text commands it is much faster to use a serial port for both sending shell
commands and received program output.

Communicating entirely using text also means that you no longer have to worry
about your needles being invalidated due to a font change or similar. It is
also much cheaper to transfer text and test it against regular expressions
than encode images from a VNC feed and test them against sample images
(needles).

On the other hand you can no longer use `assert_screen` or take a screen shot
because the text is never rendered as an image. A lot of programs will also
send ANSI escape sequences which will appear as raw text to the test script
instead of being interpreted by a terminal emulator which then renders the
text.

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
select_console('root-virtio-terminal');  # Selects a virtio based serial terminal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above code will cause `type_string` and `wait_serial` to write and read
from a virtio serial port. A distribution specific call back will be made
which allows os-autoinst to log into a serial terminal session running on the
SUT. Once `select_console` returns you should be logged into a TTY as root.

NOTE: for https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse]
tests instead of using `select_console('root-virtio-terminal')` directly is
the preferred way to use wrapper `select_serial_terminal()`, which handles all
backends:

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Selects a virtio based serial terminal if available or fallback to the best suitable console
# for the current backend.
select_serial_terminal();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are struggling to visualise what is happening, imagine SSH-ing into a
remote machine as root, you can then type in commands and read the results as
if you were sat at that computer. What we are doing is much simpler than using
an SSH connection (it is more like using GNU `screen` with a serial port), but
the end result looks quite similar.

As mentioned above, changing input and output to a serial terminal has the
effect of changing where `wait_serial` reads output from. On a QEMU VM
`wait_serial` usually reads from the default serial port which is also where
the kernel log is usually output to.

When switching to a virtio based serial terminal, `wait_serial` will then read
from a virtio serial port instead. However the default serial port still
exists and can receive output. Some utility library functions are hard coded
to redirect output to the default serial port and expect that `wait_serial`
will be able to read it. Usually it is not too difficult to fix the utility
function, you just need to remove some redirection from the relevant shell
command.

Another common problem is that some library or utility function tries to take
a screen shot. The hard part is finding what takes the screen shot, but then
it is just a simple case of checking `is_serial_terminal` and not taking the
screen shot if we are on a serial terminal console.

Distributions usually wrap `select_console`, so instead of using it directly,
you can use something like the following which is from the OpenSUSE test
suite.

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if (select_serial_terminal()) {
        # Do something which only works, or is necessary, on a serial terminal
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This selects the virtio based serial terminal console if possible. If it is
available then it returns true. It is also possible to check if the current
console is a serial terminal by calling `is_serial_terminal`.

Once you have selected a serial terminal, the video feed will disappear from
the live view, however at the bottom of the live screen there is a separate
text feed. After the test has finished you can view the serial log(s) in the
assets tab. You will probably have two serial logs; `serial0.txt` which is
written from the default serial port and `serial_terminal.txt`.

Now that you are on a serial terminal console everything will start to go a
lot faster. So much faster in fact that race conditions become a big
issue. Generally these can be avoided by using the higher level functions such
as `script_run` and `script_output`.

It is rarely necessary to use the lower level functions, however it helps to
recognise problems caused by race conditions at the lower level, so please
read the following section regardless.

So if you do need to use `type_string` and `wait_serial` directly then try to
use the following pattern:

1) Wait for the terminal prompt to appear.
2) Send your command
3) Wait for your command text to be echoed by the shell (if applicable)
4) Send enter
5) Wait for your command output (if applicable)

To illustrate this is a snippet from the LTP test runner which uses the lower
level commands to achieve a little bit more control. I have numbered the lines
which correspond to the steps above.

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my $fin_msg    = "### TEST $test->{name} COMPLETE >>> ";
my $cmd_text   = qq($test->{command}; echo "$fin_msg\$?");
my $klog_stamp = "echo 'OpenQA::run_ltp.pm: Starting $test->{name}' > /dev/$serialdev";

# More variables and other stuff

if (is_serial_terminal) {
        script_run($klog_stamp);
        wait_serial(serial_term_prompt(), undef, 0, no_regex => 1); #Step 1
        type_string($cmd_text);		  	    	     	    #Step 2
        wait_serial($cmd_text, undef, 0, no_regex => 1);	    #Step 3
        type_string("\n");     	      	 	     		    #Step 4
} else {
        # None serial terminal console code (e.g. the VNC console)
}
my $test_log = wait_serial(qr/$fin_msg\d+/, $timeout, 0, record_output => 1); #Step 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first `wait_serial` (Step 1) ensures that the shell prompt has
appeared. If we do not wait for the shell prompt then it is possible that we
can send input to whatever command was run before. In this case that command
would be 'echo' which is used by `script_run` to print a 'finished' message.

It is possible that echo was able to print the finish message, but was then
suspended by the OS before it could exit. In which case the test script is
able to race ahead and start sending input to echo which was intended for the
shell. Waiting for the shell prompt stops this from happening.

INFO: It appears that echo does not read STDIN in this case, and so the input
will stay inside STDIN's buffer and be read by the shell (Bash). Unfortunately
this results in the input being displayed twice: once by the terminal's echo
(explained later) and once by Bash. Depending on your configuration the
behavior could be completely different

The function `serial_term_prompt` is a distribution specific function which
returns the characters previously set as the shell prompt (e.g. export PS1="#
", see the bash(1) or dash(1) man pages). If you are adapting a new
distribution to use the serial terminal console, then we recommend setting a
simple shell prompt and keeping track of it with utility functions.

The `no_regex` argument tells wait_serial to use simple string matching
instead of regular expressions, see the implementation section for more
details. The other arguments are the timeout (`undef` means we use the
default) and a boolean which inverts the result of `wait_serial`. These are
explained in the `os-autoinst/testapi.pm` documentation.

Then the test script enters our command with `type_string` (Step 2) and waits
for the command's text to be echoed back by the system under test. Terminals
usually echo back the characters sent to them so that the user can see what
they have typed.

However this can be disabled (see the stty(1) man page) or possibly even
unimplemented on your terminal. So this step may not be applicable, but it
provides some error checking so you should think carefully before disabling
echo deliberately.

We then consume the echo text (Step 3) before sending enter, to both check
that the correct text was received and also to separate it from the command
output. It also ensures that the text has been fully processed before sending
the newline character which will cause the shell to change state.

It is worth reminding oneself that we are sending and receiving data
extremely quickly on an interface usually limited by human typing speed. So
any string which results in a significant state change should be treated as a
potential source of race conditions.

Finally we send the newline character and wait for our custom finish
message. `record_output` is set to ensure all the output from the SUT is
saved (see the next section for more info).

What we do *not* do at this point, is wait for the shell prompt to appear.
That would consume the prompt character breaking the next call to
`script_run`.

We choose to wait for the prompt just before sending a command, rather than
after it, so that Step 5 can be deferred to a later time. In theory this
allows the test script to perform some other work while the SUT is busy.

==== Sending new lines and continuation characters

The following command will timeout: `script_run("echo \"1\n2\"")`. The reason
being `script_run` will call `wait_serial("echo \"1\n2\"")` to check that the
command was entered successfully and echoed back (see above for explanation of
serial terminal echo, note the echo shell command has not been executed
yet). However the shell will translate the newline characters into a newline
character plus '>', so we will get something similar to the following output.

[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "1
> 2"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The '>' is unexpected and will cause the match to fail. One way to fix this is
simply to do `echo -e \"1\\n2\"`. In this case Perl will not replace \n with a
newline character, instead it will be passed to echo which will do the
substitution instead (note the '-e' switch for echo).

In general you should be aware that, Perl, the guest kernel and the shell may
transform whatever character sequence you enter. Transformations can be
spotted by comparing the input string with what `wait_serial` actually finds.

==== Sending signals - ctrl-c and ctrl-d

On a VNC based console you simply use `send_key` like follows.

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
send_key('ctrl-c');
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This usually (see termios(3)) has the effect of sending SIGINT to whatever
command is running. Most commands terminate upon receiving this signal (see
signal(7)).

On a serial terminal console the `send_key` command is not implemented (see
implementation section). So instead the following can be done to achieve the
same effect.

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type_string('', terminate_with => 'ETX');
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ETX ASCII code means End of Text and usually results in SIGINT being
raised. In fact pressing `ctrl-c` may just be translated into ETX, so you
might consider this a more direct method. Also you can use 'EOT' to do the
same thing as pressing `ctrl-d`.

You also have the option of using Perl's control character escape sequences in
the first argument to `type_string`. So you can also send ETX with:

[source,perl]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type_string("\cC");
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `terminate_with` parameter just exists to display intention. It is also
possible to send any character using the hex code like '\x0f' which may have
the effect of pressing the magic SysRq key if you are lucky.

==== The virtio serial terminal implementation

The os-autoinst package supports several types of 'consoles' of which the
virtio serial terminal is one. The majority of code for this console is
located in consoles/virtio_terminal.pm and consoles/serial_screen.pm (used also
by the svirt serial console). However there is also related code in
backends/qemu.pm and distribution.pm.

You may find it useful to read the documentation in virtio_terminal.pm and
serial_screen.pm if you need to perform some special action on a terminal such
as triggering a signal or simulating the SysRq key. There are also some
console specific arguments to `wait_serial` and `type_string` such as
`record_output`.

The virtio 'screen' essentially reads data from a socket created by QEMU into
a ring buffer and scans it after every read with a regular expression. The
ring buffer is large enough to hold anything you are likely to want to match
against, but not too large as to cause performance issues. Usually the
contents of this ring buffer, up to the end of the match, are returned by
`wait_serial`. This means earlier output will be overwritten once the ring
buffer's length is exceeded. However you can pass `record_output` which saves
the output to a separate unlimited buffer and returns that instead.

Like `record_output`, the `no_regex` argument is a console specific argument
supported by the serial terminal console. It may or may not have some
performance benefits, but more importantly it allows you to easily match
arbitrary strings which may contain regex escape sequences. To be clear,
`no_regex` hints that `wait_serial` should just treat its input as a plain
string and use the Perl library function `index` to search for a match in the
ring buffer.

The `send_key` function is not implemented for the serial terminal console
because the openQA console implementation would need to map key actions like
`ctrl-c` to a character and then send that character. This may mislead some
people into thinking they are actually sending `ctrl-c` to the SUT and also
requires openQA to choose what character `ctrl-c` represents which varies
across terminal configurations.

Very little of the code (perhaps none) is specific to a virtio based serial
terminal and can be reused with a physical serial port, SSH socket, IPMI or
some other text based interface. It is called the virtio console because the
current implementation just uses a virtio serial device in QEMU (and it could
easily be converted to an emulated port), but it otherwise has nothing to do
with the virtio standard and so you should avoid using the name 'virtio
console' unless specifically referring to the QEMU virtio implementation.

As mentioned previously, ANSI escape sequences can be a pain. So we try to
avoid them by informing the shell that it is running on a 'dumb' terminal (see
the SUSE distribution's serial terminal utility library). However some
programs ignore this, but piping there output into `tee` is usually enough to
stop them outputting non-printable characters.


== Test Development tricks
=== Trigger new tests by modifying settings from existing test runs

To trigger new tests with custom settings the command line client
`openqa-cli` can be used. To trigger new tests relying on all settings from
existing tests runs but modifying specific settings the `openqa-clone-job`
script can be used. Within the openQA repository the script is located at
`/usr/share/openqa/script/`.  This tool can be used to create a new job that
adds, removes or changes settings.

This example adds or overrides `FOO` to be `bar`, removes `BAZ` and appends
`:PR-123` to `TEST`:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
openqa-clone-job --from localhost --host localhost 42 FOO=bar BAZ= TEST+=:PR-123
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: When cloning children via `--clone-children` as well, the children are also
affected. Parent jobs (which are cloned as well by default) are _not_ affected
unless the `--parental-inheritance` flag is used.

If you do not want a cloned job to start up in the same job group as the job
you cloned from, e.g. to not pollute build results, the job group can be
overwritten, too, using the special variable `_GROUP`. Add the quoted group
name, e.g.:

[source,sh]
-------------
openqa-clone-job --from localhost 42 _GROUP="openSUSE Tumbleweed"
-------------

The special group value `0` means that the group connection will be separated
and the job will not appear as a job in any job group, e.g.:

[source,sh]
-------------
openqa-clone-job --from localhost 42 _GROUP=0
-------------

=== Backend variables for faster test execution

The `os-autoinst` backend offers multiple test variables which are helpful for
test development. For example:

* Set `_EXIT_AFTER_SCHEDULE=1` if you only want to evaluate the test schedule
  before the test modules are executed

* Use `_SKIP_POST_FAIL_HOOKS=1` to prevent lengthy post_fail_hook execution in
  case of expected and known test fails, for examples when you need to create
  needles anyway


=== Using snapshots to speed up development of tests
[id="snapshots"]

For lower turn-around times during test development based on virtual machines
the QEMU backend provides a feature that allows a job to start from a snapshot
which can help in this situation.

Depending on the use case, there are two options to help:

* Create and *preserve* snapshots for *every test* module run (`MAKETESTSNAPSHOTS`)
  - Offers more flexibility as the test can be resumed almost at any point.
    However disk space requirements are high (expect more than 30GB for one
    job).
  - This mode is useful for fixing non-fatal issues in tests and debugging SUT
    as more than just the snapshot of the last failed module is saved.

* Create a snapshot *after every successful* test module while *always
  overwriting* the existing snapshot to preserve only the latest (`TESTDEBUG`)
  - Allows to skip just before the start of the first failed test module,
    which can be limiting, but preserves disk space in comparison to
    `MAKETESTSNAPSHOTS`.
  - This mode is useful for iterative test development

In both modes there is no need to modify tests (i.e. adding `milestone` test
flag as the behaviour is implied). In the later mode every test module is
also considered `fatal`. This means the job is aborted after the first failed
test module.

[id="snapshots-for-each-module"]
==== Enable snapshots for each module

* Run the worker with `--no-cleanup` parameter. This will preserve the hard
 disks after test runs. If the worker(s) are being started via the systemd unit,
 then this can achieved by using the `openqa-worker-no-cleanup@.service` unit
 instead of `openqa-worker@.service`.

* Set `MAKETESTSNAPSHOTS=1` on a job. This will make openQA save a
snapshot for every test module run. One way to do that is by cloning an
existing job and adding the setting:

[source,sh]
----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org  --host localhost 24 MAKETESTSNAPSHOTS=1
----

* Create a job again, this time setting the `SKIPTO` variable to the snapshot
* you need. Again, `openqa-clone-job` comes handy here:

[source,sh]
----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org  --host localhost 24 SKIPTO=consoletest-yast2_i
----

* Use qemu-img snapshot -l something.img to find out what snapshots are in the image. Snapshots are named
`"test module category"-"test module name"` (e.g. `installation-start_install`).

==== Storing only the last successful snapshot

* Run the worker with `--no-cleanup parameter`. This will preserve the hard disks after test runs.
* Set `TESTDEBUG=1` on a job. This will make openQA save a snapshot after each
successful test module run. Snapshots are overwritten. The snapshot is named `lastgood` in all cases.

[source,sh]
----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org  --host localhost 24 TESTDEBUG=1
----

* Create a job again, this time setting the `SKIPTO` variable to the snapshot
which failed on previous run. Make sure the new job will also have
`TESTDEBUG=1` set. This can be ensured by the use of the clone_job script on
the clone source job or specifying the variable explicitly:

[source,sh]
----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org  --host localhost 24 TESTDEBUG=1 SKIPTO=consoletest-yast2_i
----

=== Defining a custom test schedule or custom test modules

Normally the test schedule, that is which test modules should be executed and
which order, is prescribed by the `main.pm` file within the test distribution.
Additionally it is possible to exclude certain test modules from execution
using the os-autoinst test variables `INCLUDE_MODULES` and `EXCLUDE_MODULES`.
A custom schedule can be defined using the test variable `SCHEDULE`. Also test
modules can be defined and overridden on-the-fly using a downloadable asset.
For example for the common test distribution
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse]
one could use `SCHEDULE=tests/boot/boot_to_desktop,tests/console/my_test` for
a much faster test execution that can boot an existing system and only execute
the intended test module.

https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/blob/master/doc/backend_vars.asciidoc
describes in detail the mentioned test parameters and more. Please consult
this full reference as well.

==== EXCLUDE_MODULES

If a job has the following schedule:

- boot/boot_to_desktop
- console/systemd_testsuite
- console/docker

The module console/docker can be excluded with:

----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org --host https://openqa.opensuse.org 24 EXCLUDE_MODULES=docker
----

The schedule would be:

- boot/boot_to_desktop
- console/systemd_testsuite

NOTE: Excluding modules that are not scheduled does not raise an error.

==== INCLUDE_MODULES

If a job has the following schedule:

- boot/boot_to_desktop
- console/systemd_testsuite
- console/docker

The module console/docker can be excluded with:

----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org --host https://openqa.opensuse.org 24 INCLUDE_MODULES=boot_to_desktop,systemd_testsuite
----

The schedule would be:

- boot/boot_to_desktop
- console/systemd_testsuite

NOTE: Including modules that are not scheduled does not raise an error, but they are not scheduled.

==== SCHEDULE

Additionally it is possible to define a custom schedule using the test variable `SCHEDULE`.

----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org --host https://openqa.opensuse.org 24 SCHEDULE=tests/boot/boot_to_desktop,tests/console/consoletest_setup
----

NOTE: Any existing test module within *CASEDIR* can be scheduled.

==== SCHEDULE + ASSET_<NR>_URL
Test modules can be defined and overridden on-the-fly using a
downloadable asset (combining *ASSET_<NR>_URL* and *SCHEDULE*).

For example one can schedule a job on a production instance with a custom
schedule consisting of two modules from the provided test distribution plus
one test module which is defined dynamically and downloaded as an asset from
an external trusted download domain:

----
openqa-clone-job --from https://openqa.opensuse.org --host https://openqa.opensuse.org 24 SCHEDULE=tests/boot/boot_to_desktop,tests/console/consoletest_setup,foo,bar ASSET_1_URL=https://example.org/my/test/bar.pm  ASSET_2_URL=https://example.org/my/test/foo.pm
----

NOTE: The asset number doesn't affect the schedule order. +
The test modules foo.pm and bar.pm will be downloaded into the root of the pool directory where tests and assets are used by isotovideo. For this reason, to schedule them, no path is needed.

A valid test module format looks like this:

----
use Mojo::Base 'consoletest';
use testapi;

sub run {
    select_console 'root-console';
    assert_script_run 'foo';
}

sub post_run_hook {}
1;
----

For example this can be used in bug investigations or trying out new test
modules which are hard to test locally.
The
section "Asset handling" in the <<UsersGuide.asciidoc#usersguide,Users Guide>>
describes how downloadable assets can be specified. It is important to note
that the specified asset is only downloaded once. New versions must be
supplied as new, unambiguous download target file names.

=== Triggering tests based on an any remote Git refspec or open GitHub pull request

openQA also supports to trigger tests using test code from an open pull
request on GitHub or any branch or Git refspec. That means that code changes
that are not yet available on a production instance of openQA can be tested
safely to ensure the code changes work as expected before merging the code
into a production repository and branch. This works by setting the
`CASEDIR` parameter of os-autoinst to a valid Git repository path including
an optional branch/refspec specifier. It is also possible to set `NEEDLES_DIR`
to a valid Git repository path to use custom needles.
See
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst/blob/master/doc/backend_vars.asciidoc
for details.

[NOTE]
====
The openQA worker normally default-initializes `CASEDIR` and `NEEDLES_DIR` to
point to default repositories provided by the openQA instance. This behavior
interacts with specifying a custom `CASEDIR` or `NEEDLES_DIR` in the following
way:

* If `CASEDIR` or `NEEDLES_DIR` is customized the customized location is used
  instead of the default repository.
* If only one of `CASEDIR` or `NEEDLES_DIR` is customized the other variable
  will still be initialized to point to the default repository.
* A relative `NEEDLES_DIR` is treated to be relative to the default `CASEDIR`
  (even if `CASEDIR` is customized). To have it treated to be relative to the
  custom `CASEDIR`, prefix the relative path with `%CASEDIR%/`. So specifying
  e.g. `CASEDIR=https://github.com/…` and `NEEDLES_DIR=%%CASEDIR%%/the-needles`
  will lead to `%CASEDIR%` being substituted with the path of the Git checkout
  created for the custom `CASEDIR`. That results in needles found in
  https://github.com/…/tree/…/the-needles to be used. Note that double
  `%`-signs are to avoid variable substitution. When using `curl`, you need to
  escape the `%`-sign as `%25` *in addition*.
====

A helper script `openqa-clone-custom-git-refspec` is available for
convenience that supports some combinations.

To clone one job within a remote instance based on an open github pull request
the following syntax can be used:

----
openqa-clone-custom-git-refspec $GITHUB_PR_URL $OPENQA_TEST_URL
----

For example:

----
openqa-clone-custom-git-refspec https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse/pull/6649 https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/839191
----

Note that customizing `CASEDIR` does *not* mean needles will be loaded from
there, even if the repository specified as `CASEDIR` contains needles. To load
needles from that repository, it needs to be specified as `NEEDLES_DIR` as well.

Keep in mind that if `PRODUCTDIR` is overwritten as well, it might not relate to
the state of the specified git refspec that is passed via the command line
parameter to `openqa-clone-custom-git-refspec` or via the `PRODUCTDIR` variable
to `openqa-clone-job`. Both can still be used when overwriting `PRODUCTDIR`, but
special care must be taken if the schedule is modified (then it is safer to
manually specify the schedule via the `SCHEDULE` variable).

== Running openQA jobs as CI checks
It is possible to run openQA jobs as CI checks of a repository, e.g. a test
distribution or an arbitrary repository containing software with openQA tests
as part of the test suite.

=== Create and monitor openQA jobs from within the CI runner
The easiest approach is to create and monitor openQA jobs from within the CI
runner. To make this easier, `openqa-cli` provides the `schedule` sub-command
with the `--monitor` flag. This way you still need an openQA instance to run
tests (as they are not executed within the CI runner itself) but you can also
still conveniently view the test results on the openQA web UI.

An example using GitHub actions and the official container image we provide for
`openqa-cli` can be found in the example distributions'
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/openqa.yml[workflow].

NOTE: This example makes use of the `SCENARIO_DEFINITIONS_YAML` variable which
allows specifying
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example/blob/master/scenario-definitions.yaml[scenario definitions]
in a way that is independent from openQA's normal scheduling tables. This
feature is explained in further detail in the corresponding
<<UsersGuide.asciidoc#scenarios_yaml,users guide section>>.

NOTE: This example shows that API credentials need to be present. When using
GitHub actions the secrets configured in the main repository are not made
available to PRs created from branches in fork repositories. So the credentials
need to be configured for each repository context manually. The approach
using webhooks mentioned in the next section does not have this limitation.

=== Use webhooks and status reporting APIs of GitHub
This approach is so far specific to GitHub and is a bit more effort to setup
than the approach mentioned in the previous section. For this to work, GitHub
needs to be able to inform openQA that a PR has been created or updated and
openQA needs to be able to inform GitHub about the result of the jobs it ran.
So authentication needs to be configured on both sides. On the upside, there
is no additional CI runner required and the authentication also works when a
PR is created from a fork repository branch which extra configuration.

The test scenarios for your repository need to be defined in the file
`scenario-definitions.yaml` at the root of your repository. Checkout the
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example/blob/master/scenario-definitions.yaml[scenario definitions]
from the example distribution for an example. You may append a parameter like
`SCENARIO_DEFINITIONS_YAML=path/of/yaml` to the query parameters of the
webhook to change the lookup path of this file.

==== Setup a GitHub access token for openQA
This setup is required for openQA to be able to report the status back to
GitHub.

1. Open https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token. It
   needs at least the scope "repo".
2. Open the openQA web UI's config file (usually `/etc/openqa/openqa.ini`)
   and add the token created in the previous step:
+
 [secrets]
 github_token = $token

3. Restart the web UI services.

==== Setup webhook on GitHub
This setup is required for GitHub to be able to inform openQA that a PR has
been created or updated.

1. Open https://github.com/$orga/$project/settings/hooks/new. You need to
   substitute the placeholders `$orga`  and `$project` with the corresponding
   value of the repository you want to add CI checks to.
2. Add https://$user:$apikey:$apisecret@$openqa_host/api/v1/webhooks/product?DISTRI=example&VERSION=0&FLAVOR=DVD&ARCH=x86_64&TEST=simple_boot
   as "Payload URL". You need to substitute the placeholders with valid API
   credentials and hostname for your openQA instance. If you don't have
   an API key/secret then you can create one on https://$openqa_host/api_keys.
   Make sure the casing of the user name is correct. The scheduling
   parameters need to be adjusted to produce the wanted set of jobs from
   your scenario definitions YAML file.
3. Select "application/json" as "Content type".
4. Add `$user:$apikey:$apisecret` as secret replacing placeholders again.
   You need to use the same credentials as in step 2.
5. Keep SSL enabled. (Be sure your openQA instance is reachable via HTTPS.)
6. Select "Let me select individual events." and then "Pull requests".
7. Ensure "Active" is checked and confirm.
8. GitHub should now have been delivering a "ping" event. Checkout whether
   it could be delivered. If you have gotten a 200 response then everything
   is setup correctly. Otherwise, checkout the response of the delivery to
   investigate what is wrong.
