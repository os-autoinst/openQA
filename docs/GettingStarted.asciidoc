Introduction
------------
[id="intro"]

openQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It uses virtual machines to
reproduce the process, check the output (both serial console and
screen) in every step and send the necessary keystrokes and commands to
proceed to the next. openQA can check whether the system can be installed,
whether it works properly in `live' mode, whether applications work
or whether the system responds as expected to different installation options and
commands.

Even more importantly, openQA can run several combinations of tests for every
revision of the operating system, reporting the errors detected for each
combination of hardware configuration, installation options and variant of the
operating system.

openQA is free software released under the
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GPLv2 license]. The source code and
documentation are hosted in the https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst
organization on GitHub].

This document describes the general operation and usage of openQA. The main goal
is to provide a general overview of the tool, with all the information needed to
become a happy user. More advanced topics like installation, administration or
development of new tests are covered by further documents available in the
https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[official repository].

Architecture
------------
[id="architecture"]

Although the project as a whole is referred to as openQA, there are in fact
several components that are hosted in separate repositories as shown in
<<arch_img,the following figure>>.

The heart of the test engine is a standalone application called
'os-autoinst' (blue). In each execution, this application creates a
virtual machine and uses it to run a set of test scripts (red).
'os-autoinst' generates a video, screenshots and a JSON file with
detailed results.

'openQA' (green) on the other hand provides a web based user
interface and infrastructure to run 'os-autoinst' in a distributed
way. The web interface also provides a JSON based REST-like API for
external scripting and for use by the worker program. Workers
fetch data and input files from openQA for os-autoinst to run the
tests. A host system can run serveral workers. The openQA web
application takes care of distributing test jobs among workers. Web
application and workers don't have to run on the same machine but
can be connected via network instead.

Basic concepts
--------------
[id="concepts"]

Jobs
~~~~

One of the most important features of openQA is that it can be used to test
several combinations of actions and configurations. For every one of those
combinations, the system creates a virtual machine, performs certain steps and
returns an overall result. Every one of those executions is called a 'job'.
Every job is labeled with a numeric identifier and has several associated
'settings' that will drive its behavior.

A job goes through several states:

* *scheduled* Initial state for recently created jobs. Queued for future
  execution.
* *running* In progress.
* *cancelled* The job was explicitly cancelled by the user or was replaced by a
  clone (see below).
* *waiting* The job is in `interactive mode' (see below) and waiting for input.
* *done* Execution finished.

Jobs in state 'done' have typically gone through a whole sequence of steps
(called 'testmodules') each one with its own result. But in addition to those
partial results, a finished job also provides an overall result from the
following list.

* *none* For jobs that have not reached the 'done' state.
* *passed* No critical check failed during the process. It doesn't necessarily 
  mean that all testmodules where successful or that no single assertion failed.
* *failed* At least one assertion considered to be critical was not satisfied at some
  point.
* *incomplete* The job is no longer running but no result was provided. Either
  it was cancelled while running or it crashed.

Sometimes, the reason of a failure is not an error in the tested operating system
itself, but an outdated test or a problem in the execution of the job for some
external reason. In those situations, it makes sense to re-run a given job from
the beginning once the problem is fixed or the tests have been updated.
This is done by means of 'cloning'. Every job can be superseded by a clone which
is scheduled to run with exactly the same settings as the original job. If the
original job is still not in 'done' state, it's cancelled immediately.
From that point in time, the clone becomes the current version and the original
job is considered outdated (and can be filtered in the listing) but its
information and results (if any) are kept for future reference.

Needles
~~~~~~~

One of the main mechanisms for openQA to know the state of the virtual machine
is checking the presence of some elements in the machine's `screen'.
This is performed using fuzzy image matching between the screen and the so
called 'needles'. A needle specifies both the elements to search for and a
list of tags used to decide which needles should be used at any moment.

A needle consists of a full screenshot in PNG format and a json file with
the same name (e.g. foo.png and foo.json) containing the associated data, like
which areas inside the full screenshot are relevant or the mentioned list of
tags.

[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
{
   "area" : [
      {
         "xpos" : INTEGER,
         "ypos" : INTEGER,
         "width" : INTEGER,
         "height" : INTEGER,
         "type" : ( "match" | "ocr" | "exclude" ),
         "match" : INTEGER, // 0-100. similarity percentage
      },
      ...
   ],
   "tags" : [
      STRING, ...
   ]
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactive mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several points in time during the execution of a job at which openQA
tries to match the screen with the available needles, reacting to the result of
that check. If the job is running in interactive mode it will stop the execution
at that point, freezing the virtual machine and waiting for user input before
proceeding. At that moment, the user can modify the existing needles or can
create a new one using as a starting point either the current screen of the
virtual machine or one of the existing needles. Once the needles are adjusted,
the user can command the job to reload the list of needles and continue with the
execution.

The interactive mode is especially useful when creating needles for a new
operating system or when the look & feel have changed and several needles need
to be adjusted accordingly.


Access management
-----------------
[id="auth"]

Some actions in openQA require special privileges. openQA provides
authentication through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID[openID]. By default,
openQA is configured to use the openSUSE openID provider, but it can very
easily be configured to use any other valid provider. Every time a new user logs
into an instance, a new user profile is created. That profile only
contains the openID identity and two flags used for access control:

* *operator* Means that the user is able to manage jobs, performing actions like
  creating new jobs, cancelling them, etc.
* *admin* Means that the user is able to manage users (granting or revoking
  operator and admin rights) as well as job templates and other related
  information (see the <<job_templates,the corresponding section>>).

Many of the operations in an openQA instance are not performed through the web
interface but using the REST-like API. The most obvious examples are the
workers and the scripts that fetch new versions of the operating system and
schedule the corresponding tests. Those clients must be authorized by an
operator using an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key[API key] with
an associated shared secret.

For that purpose, users with the operator flag have access in the web interface
to a page that allows them to manage as many API keys as they may need. For every
key, a secret is automatically generated. The user can then configure the
workers or any other client application to use whatever pair of API key and
secret owned by him. Any client to the REST-like API using one of those API keys
will be considered to be acting on behalf of the associated user. So the API key
not only has to be correct and valid (not expired), it also has to belong to a
user with operator rights.

For more insights about authentication, authorization and the technical details
of the openQA security model, refer to the
http://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/02/28/about-openqa-and-authentication/[detailed
blog post] about the subject by the openQA development team.

Using job templates to automate jobs creation
---------------------------------------------
[id="job_templates"]

The problem
~~~~~~~~~~~

When testing an operating system, especially when doing continuous testing,
there is always a certain combination of jobs, each one with its own
settings, that needs to be run for every revision. Those combinations can be
different for different `flavors' of the same revision, like running a different
set of jobs for each architecture or for the Full and the Lite versions. This
combinational problem can go one step further if openQA is being used for
different kinds of tests, like running some simple pre-integration tests
for some snapshots combined with more comprehensive post-integration tests for
release candidates.

This section describes how an instance of openQA can be configured using the
options in the admin area to automatically create all the required jobs for each
revision of your operating system that needs to be tested. If you are starting
from scratch, you should probably go through the following order:

. Define machines in 'Machines' menu
. Define medium types (products) you have in 'Medium Types' menu
. Specify various collections of tests you want to run in the 'Test suites'
  menu
. Go to the template matrix in 'Job templates' menu and decide what
  combinations do make sense and need to be tested

In openQA we can parametrize a test to describe for what product it will
run and for what kind of machines it will be executed. For example, a
test like KDE can be run for any product that has KDE installed, and
can be tested in x86-64 and i586 machines. If we write this as a
triples, we can create a list like this to characterize KDE tests:

  (Product,             Test Suite, Machine)
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        Laptop-64bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-64bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        32bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        Laptop-32bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-32bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        Laptop-64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-64bit)

For every triplet, we need to configure a different instance of
os-autoinst with a different set of parameters.

Medium Types (products)
~~~~~~~~

A medium type (product) in openQA is a simple description without any concrete
meaning. It basically consists of a name and a set of variables that
define or characterize this product in os-autoinst.

For example, the product openSUSE-DVD-x86_64 requires the variables
+ISO_MAXSIZE+ and +DVD+ to be set up.

The list of variables is dynamic. The semantic of a variable is defined
by the tests using it. Some usual
variables are:

* +ISO_MAXSIZE+ contains the maximum size of the product. There is a
  test that checks that the current size of the product is less or
  equal than this variable.
* +DVD+ if it is set to 1, this indicates that the medium is a DVD.
* +LIVECD+ if it is set to 1, this indicates that the medium is a live
  image (can be a CD or USB)
* +GNOME+ this variable, if it is set to 1, indicates that it is a GNOME
  only distribution.
* +PROMO+ marks the promotional product.
* +RESCUECD+ is set to 1 for rescue CD images.


Test Suites
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the form where we define the different tests that we created
for openQA. A test consists of a name, a priority (used in the
scheduler to choose the next job) and a set of variables that are used
inside this particular test.

Again, the list of variables is not complete, because they are
test-dependent, but some of the usual ones are:

* +BTRFS+ if set, the file system will be BtrFS.
* +DESKTOP+ possible values are 'kde' 'gnome' 'lxde' 'xfce' or
  'textmode'. Used to indicate the desktop selected by the user during
  the test.
* +DOCRUN+ used for documentation tests.
* +DUALBOOT+ dual boot testing, needs HDD_1 and HDDVERSION.
* +ENCRYPT+ encrypt the home directory via YaST.
* +HDDMODEL+ variable to set the HDD hardware model.
* +HDDSIZEGB+ hard disk size in GB. Used together with BtrFS variable.
* +HDDVERSION+ used together with HDD_1 to set the operating system
  previously installed on the hard disk.
* +HDD_1+ path for the pre-created hard disk.
* +INSTALLONLY+ only basic installation.
* +INSTLANG+ installation language. Actually used only in documentation
  tests.
* +LIVETEST+ the test is on a live medium, do not install the distribution.
* +LVM+ select LVM volume manager.
* +NICEVIDEO+ used for rendering a result video for use in show rooms,
  skipping ugly and boring tests.
* +NOAUTOLOGIN+ unmark autologin in YaST
* +NUMDISKS+ total number of disks in QEMU.
* +QEMUVGA+ parameter to declare the video hardware configuration in QEMU.
* +RAIDLEVEL+ RAID configuration variable
* +REBOOTAFTERINSTALL+ if set to 1, will reboot after the installation.
* +SCREENSHOTINTERVAL+ used with NICEVIDEO to improve the video quality.
* +SPLITUSR+ a YaST configuration option.
* +TOGGLEHOME+ a YaST configuration option.
* +UPGRADE+ upgrade testing, need HDD_1 and HDDVERSION.
* +VIDEOMODE+ if the value is 'text', the installation will be done in
  text mode.

Machines
~~~~~~~~

You need to have at least one machine set up to be able to run any
tests. Those machines represent virtual machine types that you want to
test. To make tests actually happen, you have to have an 'openQA
worker' connected that can fulfill those specifications.

* *Name.* User defined string - only needed for operator to identify the machine
configuration.

* *Backend.* What backend should be used for this machine. Recommended value is
+qemu+ as it is the most tested one, but other options (such as +kvm2usb+ or +vbox+)
are also possible.

* *Variables* Variables represent a way how to influence backend behaviour.
Few important examples:
** +QEMUCPU+ can be 'qemu32' or 'qemu64' and specifies the architecture of the
   virtual CPU.
** +QEMUCPUS+ is an integer that specifies the number of cores you wish for.
** +LAPTOP+ if set to 1, QEMU will create a laptop profile.
** +USBBOOT+ when set to 1, the image will be loaded through an
   emulated USB stick.
** +SMP+ enables smp when set to 1, disables when set to 0.

Variable expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any variable defined in Test Suite, Machine or Product table can refer to another
variable using this syntax: %NAME%

For example this variable defined for Test Suite:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLISH_HDD_1 = %DISTRI%-%VERSION%-%ARCH%-%DESKTOP%.qcow2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

is expanded to this job variable:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLISH_HDD_1 = opensuse-13.1-i586-kde.qcow2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing openSUSE
----------------

Easiest way to start using openQA is to start testing openSUSE as we have
everything setup and prepared to ease the initial deployment. If you want to
play deeper, you can configure the whole openQA manually from scratch, but this
document should help you to get started faster.

Getting tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to get actual tests. You can get openSUSE tests and needles (the
expected results) from 
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[GitHub]. It belongs
into the +/var/lib/openqa/tests/opensuse+ directory. To make it easier, you can just
run

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/share/openqa/script/fetchneedles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will download the tests to the correct location and will set the correct
rights as well.

Getting openQA configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get everything configured to actually run the tests, there are plenty of
options to set in the admin interface. If you plan to test openSUSE Factory, using
tests mentioned in the previous section, the easiest way to get started is the
following command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/var/lib/openqa/tests/opensuse/templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will load some default settings that were used at some point of time in
openSUSE production openQA. Therefore those should work reasonably well with
openSUSE tests and needles.

Adding a new iso to test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start testing a new ISO put it in +/var/lib/openqa/factory/iso+ and call
the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Run the first test
/usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post \
         ISO=openSUSE-Factory-NET-x86_64-Build0053-Media.iso \
         DISTRI=opensuse \
         VERSION=Factory \
         FLAVOR=NET \
         ARCH=x86_64 \
         BUILD=0053
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your openQA is not running on port 80 on 'localhost', you can add option
+--host=http://otherhost:9526+ to specify a different port or host.

WARNING: Using only iso name in 'client' command and saving it in
+/var/lib/openqa/factory/iso+ is recommended as is using Factory isos. ISOs are
not uploaded from the path that you would specify.
