== Introduction

openQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It's free software released
under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GPLv2 license]. The
source code and documentation are hosted in the
https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst organization on GitHub].

This document provides the information needed to start contributing to the
openQA development improving the tool, fixing bugs and implementing new
features. For information about writing or improving openQA tests, refer to the
Tests Developer Guide. In both documents it's assumed that the reader is already
familiar with openQA and has already read the Starter Guide. All those documents
are available at the
https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[official repository].

== Development guidelines
[id="guidelines"]

As mentioned, the central point of development is the
https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst organization on GitHub] where several
repositories can be found:

* https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[openQA] containing documentation,
  server, worker and other support scripts.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst[os-autoinst] with the standalone
  test tool.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse]
  containing the tests used in http://openqa.opensuse.org
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse[os-autoinst-needles-opensuse]
  with the needles associated to the tests in the former repository.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example[os-autoinst-distri-example]
  with an almost empty set of tests meant to be used to start writing tests (and
  creating the corresponding needles) from scratch for a new operating system.

As in most projects hosted on GitHub, pull request are always welcome and
are the right way to contribute improvements and fixes.

=== Rules for commits
[id="rules_for_commits"]

* Every commit is checked by https://travis-ci.org/travis[Travis CI] as soon as
you create a pull request but you *should* run the tidy script locally,
i.e. before every commit call:

[source,sh]
----
./script/tidy
----

to ensure your Perl code changes are consistent with the style rules.

* You *may* also run local tests on your machine or in your own development
environment to verify everything works as expected. Call:

[source,sh]
----
make test
----

for unit and integration tests.

To execute a single test, one can use +prove+. You must set +TEST_PG+ so the database
can be found. If you set a custom base directory, be sure to unset it when running tests.
Example:
[source,sh]
----
TEST_PG='DBI:Pg:dbname=openqa_test;host=/dev/shm/tpg' OPENQA_BASEDIR= prove -v t/14-grutasks.t
----

To speed up the test initialization, start PostgreSQL using +t/test_postgresql+
instead of using the system service. Eg.
[source,sh]
----
t/test_postgresql /dev/shm/tpg
----

* For git commit messages use the rules stated on
http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/[How to Write a Git Commit Message] as
a reference

* Every pull request is reviewed in a peer review to give feedback on possible
implications and how we can help each other to improve

If this is too much hassle for you feel free to provide incomplete pull
requests for consideration or create an issue with a code change proposal.

== Getting involved into development
[id="getting_involved"]

But developers willing to get really involved into the development of openQA or
people interested in following the always-changing roadmap should take a look
at the https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3[openQAv3 project] in
openSUSE's project management tool. This Redmine instance is used to coordinate
the main development effort organizing the existing issues (bugs and desired
features) into 'target versions'.

Currently developers meet in IRC channel
irc://chat.freenode.net/opensuse-factory[#opensuse-factory] and in a daily
https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts[jangouts] call of the core developer team.

In addition to the ones representing development sprints, two other versions are
always open. https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73[Easy hacks] lists issues
that are not specially urgent and that are considered to be easy to implement
by newcomers. Developers looking for a place to start contributing
are encouraged to simply go to that list and assign any open issue to themselves.
https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/90[Future improvements] groups features
that are in the developers' and users' wish list but that have little chances to be
addressed in the short term, either because the return of investment is not
worth it or because they are out of the current scope of the development.

openQA and os-autoinst repositories also include test suites aimed at preventing
bugs and regressions in the software. https://codecov.io/[codecov] is
configured in the repositories to encourage contributors to raise the tests
coverage with every commit and pull request. New features and bug fixes are
expected to be backed with the corresponding tests.

== Technologies
[id="technologies"]

Everything in openQA, from +os-autoinst+ to the web frontend and from the tests
to the support scripts is written in Perl. So having some basic knowledge
about that language is really desirable in order to understand and develop
openQA. Of course, in addition to bare Perl, several libraries and additional
tools are required. The easiest way to install all needed dependencies is
using the available os-autoinst and openQA packages, as described in the
Installation Guide.

In the case of os-autoinst, only a few http://www.cpan.org/[CPAN] modules are
required. Basically +Carp::Always+, +Data::Dump+. +JSON+ and +YAML+. On the other
hand, several external tools are needed including
http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page[QEMU],
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/[Tesseract] and
http://optipng.sourceforge.net/[OptiPNG]. Last but not least, the
http://opencv.org/[OpenCV] library is the core of the openQA image matching
mechanism, so it must be available on the system.

The openQA package is built on top of Mojolicious, an excellent Perl framework
for web development that will be extremely familiar to developers coming from
other modern web frameworks like Sinatra and that have nice and comprehensive
documentation available at its http://mojolicio.us[home page].

In addition to Mojolicious and its dependencies, several other CPAN modules are
required by the openQA package. For a full list of hard dependencies, see the
file +cpanfile+ at the root of the openQA repository.

openQA relies on PostgreSQL to store the information. It used to support SQLite,
but that is no longer possible.

As stated in the previous section, every feature implemented in both packages
should be backed by proper tests.
http://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html[Test::More] is used to implement those
tests. As usual, tests are located under the +/t/+ directory. In the openQA
package, one of the tests consists of a call to
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/[Perltidy] to ensure that the contributed code
follows the most common Perl style conventions.

== Starting the webserver from local Git checkout
* To start the webserver for development, use the +scripts/openqa daemon+.
* openQA will pull the required asssets on the first run.
* openQA uses SASS, so Ruby development files are required. Under openSUSE,
  installing the packages +devel_C_C+++ and +ruby-devel+ should be sufficient.
  openQA will install the required files automatically under +.gem+. Add
  +.gem/ruby/2.4.0/bin+ to the +PATH+ variable to let it find the sass/scss
  binaries. I also had to create symlinks of those binaries without +.ruby2.4+
  suffix so openQA could find them.
* It is also useful to start openQA with morbo which allows applying changes
  without restarting the server:
  +morbo -m development -w assets -w lib -w templates
    -l http://localhost:9526 script/openqa daemon+


== Managing the database

During the development process there are cases in which the database schema
needs to be changed.
there are some steps that have to be followed so that new database instances
and upgrades include those changes.

=== When is it required to update the database schema?
After modifying files in +lib/OpenQA/Schema/Result+. However, not all changes
require to update the schema. Adding just another method or altering/adding
functions like +has_many+ doesn't require an update. However, adding new
columns, modifying or removing existing ones requires to follow the steps
mentioned above.

=== How to update the database schema

1. First, you need to increase the database version number in the `$VERSION`
   variable in the +lib/OpenQA/Schema.pm+ file.
   Note that it's recommended to notify the other developers before doing so,
   to synchronize in case there are more developers wanting to increase the
   version number at the same time.

2. Then you need to generate the deployment files for new installations,
   this is done by running +./script/initdb --prepare_init+.

3. Afterwards you need to generate the deployment files for existing installations,
   this is done by running +./script/upgradedb --prepare_upgrade+.
   After doing so, the directories +dbicdh/$ENGINE/deploy/<new version>+ and
   +dbicdh/$ENGINE/upgrade/<prev version>-<new version>+ for PosgreSQL
   should have been created with some SQL files inside containing the statements to
   initialize the schema and to upgrade from one version
   to the next in the corresponding database engine.

4. Migration scripts to upgrade from previous versions can be added under
   +dbicdh/_common/upgrade+. Create a +<prev_version>-<new_version>+ directory and
   put some files there with DBIx commands for the migration. For examples just
   have a look at the migrations which are already there.

The above steps are only for preparing the required SQL statements, but do not
actually alter the database. Before doing so, it is recommended *to backup your
database* to be able to downgrade again if something goes wrong or you just need
to continue working on another branch. To do so, the following command can be
used to create a copy:
[source,sh]
----
createdb -O ownername -T originaldb newdb
----

To actually create or update the database (after creating a backup as described),
you should run either +./script/initdb --init_database+ or
+./script/upgradedb --upgrade_database+. This is also required when the changes
are installed in a production server.

=== How to add fixtures to the database

Note: This section is not about the fixtures for the testsuite. Those are located
under t/fixtures.

Note: This section might not be relevant anymore. At least there are currently
none of the mentioned directories with files containing SQL statements present.

Fixtures (initial data stored in tables at installation time) are stored
in files into the +dbicdh/_common/deploy/_any/<version>+ and
+dbicdh/_common/upgrade/<prev_version>-<next_version>+ directories.

You can create as many files as you want in each directory. These files contain
SQL statements that will be executed when initializing or upgrading a database.
Note that those files (and directories) have to be created manually.

Executed SQL statements can be traced by setting the +DBIC_TRACE+ environment
variable.

[source,sh]
----
export DBIC_TRACE=1
----

== How to overwrite config files

It can be necessary during development to change the config files in +etc/+.
For example you have to edit etc/openqa/database.ini to use another database.
Or to increase the log level it's useful to set the loglevel to debug in
etc/openqa/openqa.ini.

To avoid these changes getting in your git workflow, copy them to a new
directory and set OPENQA_CONFIG in your shell setup files.

[source,sh]
----
cp -ar etc/openqa etc/mine
export OPENQA_CONFIG=$PWD/etc/mine
----


Note that OPENQA_CONFIG points to the directory containing openqa.ini, database.ini,
client.conf and workers.ini.

[[setup-postgresql]]
== How to setup PostgreSQL to test locally with production data

1. Install PosgreSQL - under openSUSE the following package are required:
   +postgresql-server postgresql-init+

2. Start the server: +systemctl start postgresql+

3. The following steps need to be done by the user postgres: +su - postgres+

4. Create user: +createuser your_username+ where +your_username+ must be the same
   as the UNIX user you start your local openQA instance with.

5. Create database: +createdb -O your_username openqa+

6. The next steps must be done by the user you start your local openQA instance with.

7. Import dump: +pg_restore -c -d openqa path/to/dump+

8. Configure openQA to use PostgreSQL as described in the section <<Installing.asciidoc#database,Database>> of the installation guide.
 User name and password are not required.

== Adding new authentication module

OpenQA comes with three authentication modules providing authentication methods:
OpenID, iChain and Fake (see <<Installing.asciidoc#authentication,User authentication>>).

All authentication modules reside in +lib/OpenQA/Auth+ directory. During
OpenQA start, +[auth]/method+ section of +/etc/openqa/openqa.ini+ is read and according
to its value (or default OpenID) OpenQA tries to require OpenQA::WebAPI::Auth::$method.
If successful, module for given method is imported or the OpenQA ends with error.


Each authentication module is expected to export +auth_login+ and +auth_logout+ functions. In case of request-response mechanism (as in
OpenID), +auth_response+ is imported on demand.

Currently there is no login page because all implemented methods use either 3rd party
page or none.

Authentication module is expected to return HASH:
[source,perl]
----

%res = (
    # error = 1 signals auth error
    error => 0|1
    # where to redirect the user
    redirect => ''
);
----

Authentication module is expected to create or update user entry in OpenQA database
after user validation. See included modules for inspiration.

== Customize base directory

It is possible to customize the openQA base directory by setting the environment
variable +OPENQA_BASEDIR+. The default value is +/var/lib+.

== Running tests of openQA itself

There's two ways of executing the testsuite locally:

1. with docker +
  The goal of running the tests with docker is to have consistent tests results (as sometimes the tests have different outcomes because 
  missing packages or different package versions amongst other reasons). This is the preferred way if the user wants to run a full test
  battery or if it needs to setup a test database

2. without docker

=== How to run tests with docker

To run them in docker please be sure that docker is installed and the docker daemon is running.
To launch the test suite first it's required to pull the docker image:

  docker pull registry.opensuse.org/devel/openqa/containers/openqa_dev:latest

Build the image using Makefile target:

  make docker-test-build

Launch the tests using Makefile target:

  make docker-test-run

Run tests by invoking Docker manually:

  docker run -v OPENQA_LOCAL_CODE:/opt/openqa -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -e VAR1=1 -e VAR2=1 openqa:latest make docker-tests

Replace OPENQA_LOCAL_CODE to the location where you have the openqa code.

Replace VAR1 and VAR2 in -e switch to match a test battery of the test matrix:
|============================
|FULLSTACK=0| UITESTS=0
|FULLSTACK=0| UITESTS=1
|GH_PUBLISH=true| FULLSTACK=1
|SCHEDULER_FULLSTACK=1|
|DEVELOPER_FULLSTACK=1|
|============================

==== tips

Running commands will be executed after the initialization script (database creation and so on..). So if there's the need to run an interactive
session after it just do:

  docker run -it -v OPENQA_LOCAL_CODE:/opt/openqa -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus registry.opensuse.org/devel/openqa/containers/openqa_dev bash

Of course you can also use +make docker-tests \; bash+ to run the tests first and then open a shell for further investigation.

There's also the possibility to change the initialization scripts with the --entrypoint switch. This allows us to go into an interactive
session without any initialization script run:

  docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash -v OPENQA_LOCAL_CODE:/opt/openqa -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus registry.opensuse.org/devel/openqa/containers/openqa_dev

In case there's the need to follow what's happening in the current running docker (the execution will terminate the session):

  docker exec -ti $(docker ps | awk '!/CONTAINER/{print $1}') /bin/bash

Running UI tests in non-headless mode is also possible, eg.:

  xhost +local:root
  docker run --rm -ti --name openqa-testsuite -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -e DISPLAY="$DISPLAY" -e NOT_HEADLESS=1 prove -v t/ui/14-dashboard.t
  xhost -local:root

It is also possible to use a custom os-autoinst checkout using the following arguments:

  docker run ... -e CUSTOM_OS_AUTOINST=1 -v /path/to/your/os-autoinst:/opt/os-autoinst make docker-tests

By default, +configure+ and +make+ are still executed (so a clean checkout is expected). If your checkout is already prepared to use, set +CUSTOM_OS_AUTOINST_SKIP_BUILD+ to
prevent this. Be aware that the build produced outside of the container might not work inside the container if both environments provide different, incompatible library
versions (eg. OpenCV).

It is also important to mention that your local repositories will be copied into the container. This can take very long if those are big, eg. when the openQA repo contains a lot of
profiling data because you enabled +Mojolicious::Plugin::NYTProf+.

In general, if starting the tests via Docker seems to hang, it is a good idea to inspect the process tree to see which command is currently executed.

=== How to run tests without docker

To execute the testsuite locally without docker, use +make test+. It is also possible to run a
particular test for example +prove t/api/01-workers.t+.

To run UI tests the package +perl-Selenium-Remote-Driver+ is required. Note that
the version provided by Leap 42.2 is too old. The version from the repository
+devel-languages-perl+ can be used instead.

You need to install chromedriver and either chrome or chromium for the ui tests.
