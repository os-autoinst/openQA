Introduction
------------
[id="intro"]

openQA is an automated test tool that makes it possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It's free software released
under the http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GPLv2 license]. The
source code and documentation are hosted in the
https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst organization on GitHub].

This document provides the information needed to start contributing to the
openQA development improving the tool, fixing bugs and implementing new
features. For information about writing or improving openQA tests, refer to the
Tests Developer Guide. In both documents it's assumed that the reader is already
familiar with openQA and has already read the Starter Guide. All those documents
are available at the 
https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[official repository].

Development guidelines
----------------------
[id="guidelines"]

As mentioned, the central point of development is the
https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst organization on GitHub] where several
repositories can be found:

* https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[openQA] containing documentation,
  server, worker and other support scripts.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst[os-autoinst] with the standalone
  test tool.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse[os-autoinst-distri-opensuse]
  containing the tests used in http://openqa.opensuse.org
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse[os-autoinst-needles-opensuse]
  with the needles associated to the tests in the former repository.
* https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-example[os-autoinst-distri-example]
  with an almost empty set of tests meant to be used to start writing tests (and
  creating the corresponding needles) from scratch for a new operating system.

As in most projects hosted on GitHub, pull request are always welcome and
are the right way to contribute improvements and fixes. But developers
willing to get really involved into the development of openQA or people
interested in following the always-changing roadmap should take a look at the
https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3[openQAv2 project] in
openSUSE's project management tool. This Redmine instance is used to
coordinate the main development effort organizing the existing issues (bugs and
desired features) into `target versions'.

In general, the development is arranged in short sprints with a duration of around
two weeks, with a previous kickoff meeting and a wrap up meeting at the end. Both
meetings are done using http://www.google.com/hangouts/[Google Hangout]. During
the kickoff meeting a new version is created in the management tool (with an
agreed due date) and several issues are assigned to it. The
https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings/roadmap[roadmap view] is the
most convenient way to see which features and bug fixes are being addressed at a
given point in time.

In addition to the ones representing development sprints, two other versions are
always open. https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73[Easy hacks] lists issues
that are not specially urgent and that are considered to be easy to implement
by newcomers. Developers looking for a place to start contributing
are encouraged to simply go to that list and assign any open issue to themselves.
https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/90[Future improvements] groups features
that are in the developers' and users' wish list but that have little chances to be
addressed in the short term, either because the return of investment is not
worth it or because they are out of the current scope of the development.

openQA and os-autoinst repositories also include test suites aimed at preventing
bugs and regressions in the software. https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] is
configured in the repositories to encourage contributors to raise the tests
coverage with every commit and pull request. New features and bug fixes are
expected to be backed with the corresponding tests.

Technologies
------------
[id="technologies"]

Everything in openQA, from +os-autoinst+ to the web frontend and from the tests
to the support scripts is written in Perl. So having some basic knowledge
about that language is really desirable in order to understand and develop
openQA. Of course, in addition to bare Perl, several libraries and additional
tools are required. The easiest way to install all needed dependencies is
using the available os-autoinst and openQA packages, as described in the
Installation Guide.

In the case of os-autoinst, only a few http://www.cpan.org/[CPAN] modules are
required. Basically +Carp::Always+, +Data::Dump+. +JSON+ and +YAML+. On the other
hand, several external tools are needed including
http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page[QEMU],
https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/[Tesseract] and
http://optipng.sourceforge.net/[OptiPNG]. Last but not least, the
http://opencv.org/[OpenCV] library is the core of the openQA image matching
mechanism, so it must be available on the system.

The openQA package is built on top of Mojolicious, an excellent Perl framework
for web development that will be extremely familiar to developers coming from
other modern web frameworks like Sinatra and that have nice and comprehensive
documentation available at its http://mojolicio.us[home page].

In addition to Mojolicious and its dependencies, several other CPAN modules are
required by the openQA package. For a full list of hard dependencies, see the
file DEPENDENCIES.txt at the root of the openQA repository. Some additional
modules could be required when using a database engine other than the default
SQLite.

As already mentioned, openQA relies on a database engine to store the
information. PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3 are supported, with the latter being
the default option.

Lastly, +png2theora+ (part of the http://www.theora.org/[Theora project]) is
used to create a video from the screenshots generated by os-autoinst.

As stated in the previous section, every feature implemented in both packages
should be backed by proper tests.
http://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html[Test::More] is used to implement those
tests. As usual, tests are located under the +/t/+ directory. In the openQA
package, one of the tests consists of a call to
http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/[Perltidy] to ensure that the contributed code
follows the most common Perl style conventions.

Managing the database
---------------------

How to change the database schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the development process there are cases in which the database schema
needs to be changed. After modifying files in +lib/OpenQA/Schema/Result+
there are some steps that have to be followed so that new database instances
and upgrades include those changes.

.  First, you need to increase the database version number in the $VERSION
   variable at the first lines of the +lib/OpenQA/Schema/Schema.pm+ file.
   Note that it's recommended to notify the other developers before doing so,
   to synchronize in case there are more developers wanting to increase the
   version number at the same time.

.  Then you need to generate the deployment files for new installations,
   this is done by running +./initdb --prepare_init+ in the +scripts+ directory.

.  Afterwards you need to generate the deployment files for new installations,
   this is done by running +./upgradedb --prepare_upgrade+ in the +scripts+
   directory. +
   After doing so, the directories +dbicdh/$ENGINE/deploy/<new version>+ and
   +dbicdh/$ENGINE/upgrade/<prev version>-<new version>+ for SQLite, PosgreSQL
   and MySQL should have been created with some SQL files inside containing
   the statements to initialize the schema and to upgrade from one version
   to the next in the corresponding database engine.

.  And finally, you need to create the fixtures files. Under
   +dbicdh/_common/deploy+, rename the directory of the (previous) latest version
   to the new version and do the necessary changes (if any). Then, under
   +dbicdh/_common/upgrade+ create a +<prev_version>-<new_version>+ directory and
   put some files there with SQL statements that upgrade the fixtures. Usually a
   diff from the previous version to the new one helps to see what has to be in
   the upgrade file.

The above steps are executed in the developer's system. Once openQA is
installed in a production server, you should run either
+./initdb --init_database+ or +./upgradedb --upgrade_database+ to actually
create or upgrade a database.

How to add fixtures to the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixtures (initial data stored in tables at installation time) are stored
in files into the +dbicdh/_common/deploy/_any/<version>+ and
+dbicdh/_common/upgrade/<prev_version>-<next_version>+ directories.

You can create as many files as you want in each directory. These files contain
SQL statements that will be executed when initializing or upgrading a database.
Note that those files (and directories) have to be created manually and they
shouldn't create a transaction, since each file is already automatically
executed in its own transaction (so that changes are rolled back if there's any
problem) and sqlite doesn't support nested transactions.

Executed SQL statements can be traced by setting the +DBIC_TRACE+ environment
variable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export DBIC_TRACE=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to overwrite config files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can be necessary during development to change the config files in lib/,
e.g. to use postgresql or mysql you have to change lib/database.ini or to
increase the log level it's useful to set the loglevel = debug in
lib/openqa.ini.

To avoid these changes getting in your git workflow, copy them to a new
directory and set OPENQA_CONFIG in your shell setup files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir etc/mine
cp lib/database.ini etc/mine
cp lib/openqa.ini etc/mine
export OPENQA_CONFIG=$PWD/etc/mine/openqa.ini
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that OPENQA_CONFIG points to the file path of openqa.ini and database.ini
is taken from the same path.
