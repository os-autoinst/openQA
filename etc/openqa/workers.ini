# try to copy assets on the file system instead of uploading them to the
# webui via HTTP, for much better performance (webui and worker need to be

# scale very large openQA setups with many workers. However, it should not
# exceed "STATUS_MAX_INTERVAL".

# very large openQA setups with many workers. However, you need to ensure
