Dockerfiles which define images for CircleCI

The images are pre-built in OBS
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:openQA:ci

base - used to determine list of actual dependencies with versions
installed by openQA-devel package, then used as a base to install 
cached packages inside CI.
The script .circleci/build_dependencies.sh will update dependencies.txt file 
with list of new packages inside base image after installing openQA-devel.
The script .circeci/build_cache.sh is used inside circleci (both remote and 
local) to create testing environment by installing packages from 
 .circleci/dependencies.txt onto base image.

dependency_bot provides an image with docker, git and few other tools. It
is used in .circleci/config.cnf to .circleci/build_dependencies.sh

These files normally don't need to be maintained, unless processes described
above must be tweaked now and then.
